My one suggestion would be if you could jail the next person on the list. If there is a mafia about and they were next on the list, they would know they are about to die so would use their kill before its too late. Jailing them will prevent this.</p>
<p>IE. We kill Jeff today, and Clarence is next, if he were mafia he wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to use it. if there were a kill in the night, we would know not to kill Clarence since he was jailed.<br />
The following night, you would jail Victoria. Victoria would then not be able to use her night ability if she is mafia, so if she wants to use it before she dies, she would need to use it tonight, or not at all.</p>

"<p>sorry i left my posting till so late guys, still quite busy out of game.<br />
for why i did nothing last night: what had been said yesterday was quite vague, and there didn&#8217;t seem to be much of an agreed upon action plan, thus i decided on my own. i think there are still mafia about, but am unsure, so thought that it would be best to do nothing. with so few of us left in the game, i didn&#8217;t want to risk masking an attempted mafia kill, which would tell us if there were actually any left. i know it sounds pretty bad, but i thought it the best course of action at the time, since it would provide some valuable information. of other importance to me is that at the moment, i don&#8217;t really trust anyone. I have no idea who is townie, and who is other, and this worries me. I&#8217;ve been really bad with picking who i thought was townie, so now I&#8217;m at a point where i don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;d want to save, as i don&#8217;t really want to protect someone who isn&#8217;t townie. so don&#8217;t be offended if i&#8217;m skeptical of the current plan, but its really hard for me to decide who is actually trust worthy. for all i know, the people leading this new plan are cult or mafia themselves.</p>
",True
"<p>Manuel claimed that he kept his powers, and there are a few post were Cynthia implies they do. Unfortunately they both have incentive to lie about it. In my mind it comes down to this:</p>
<p>Manuel didn&#8217;t investigate anyone night 10, according to himself, because he&#8217;d just found out who the cult was and didn&#8217;t see the point in invesitigating anyone. Because the cult doesn&#8217;t care about finding the mafia? I find this story unlikely. Then according to Peter, Manuel didn&#8217;t investigate anyone night 11. It might be that Manuel didn&#8217;t bother because after we lynched the probable last mafia he saw no use in playing anymore, but the night ended early implying that everyone sent through their night roles if they have one.</p>
<p>Cynthia&#8217;s plan to be shot in the night was either pure desperation to stave off a lynch, or she honestly believed she&#8217;d be safe because she had converted a healing role. It&#8217;s why I incarcerated Jeff night 10 when Cynthia was killed in the night, and apparently Heidi also targeted him with the same belief. </p>
<p>The weak evidence listed points more towards recruits losing their powers. But it&#8217;s not conclusive. And, Peter could be lying. Like I said I expected a result of &#8220;couldn&#8217;t find him&#8221; from Peter today and he instead said &#8220;didn&#8217;t do anything&#8221;. Now, Peter&#8217;s investigations are different from Max&#8217;s, and this difference probably means nothing, but I always try to point out every possibility.</p>

<p>I incarcerated Jeff last night. It was to simultaneously test Peter and myself. I thought peter would receive a similar message to Max that he couldn&#8217;t find his target. In retrospect I should&#8217;ve targeted Peter directly, but I also wanted to see what Jeff would say to any allegations raised by the night actions. Apparently it&#8217;s nothing, which isn&#8217;t the best strategy in the world.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t want to Lynch Jeff today since it might be my fault. If we wasn&#8217;t to follow the plan, I think the best course of action is to have Jeff target Victoria, who in turn targets a random person.

I am on my phone so this will be short. My Simpsons character is Bart. As I said I was informed of being a vanilla townie at the start of the game. There is a possibility I am sibling to a lisa. Is anyone in this game Lisa? If I have a role it would need to be one kept secret from me. When I was given my vigilante kill I was told that my vigilante streak had awakened as I knew that Rosie was not what she appeared to be. I have no idea of any role I could be apart from a kill given to restore balance to the game. My kill had to be used last night and I have had no indication I will be given another. Unless I am the vigilante permanently now and will find out tonight?</p>
<p>Now elseswhere you&#8217;ve stated you have information that Rosie was on the side of the town. But if you are allowed to reveal it, and I don&#8217;t see why you wouldn&#8217;t be, I would love clarification on exactly what you were told? Because if the message is just &#8220;you knew that Rosie was not what she appeared to be&#8221; I would assume the &#8220;story&#8221; is you just knew she was lying about being a townie. Not some elaborate plot involving a death miller or mafia informant. Her claims of being sorry tomorrow seem to me just to be the last ditch claims of a mafia not wanting to be lynched.</p>

However I have an extreemely busy real life at the moment (wont say what exactly for fear of godkill) and so planned to check again yesterday early evening (before te scheduled deadline) however I then checked and discovered the day was over. </p>
<p>Now some thoughts. I have been looking back at the people who have been voting for me in the past and I have noticed a pattern where confirmed cult members (Cynthia, manuel and Charles) would all vote for me before moving to someone else. The only other person following this pattern of voting was jeff. Thus I believe jeff to also be cult. The cult members decided that I was the most suspicious townie (I don&#8217;t blame them, my lack of roleclaim doesn&#8217;t sere me well) and so tried to lead a bandwagon every time to ensure a cult majority. However on each occasion they switched votes to ensure another non-cult death (day 7 to neutral Chris, day 8 they went for detective max, day 9 they held the tie, day 10 to mafia Paul)</p>
<p>This I am suspicious of jeff, Heidi and Beth also conform somewhat to this pattern however they lack jeffs other suspicious behaviour. </p>

<p>It puts an awful lot of control into the hands of peter. Which is probably fine, because if we are all still here tomorrow it implies Cynthia probably couldn&#8217;t recruit on her final night.</p>
<p>We can only gain information about Jeff, Victoria and myself. No one else is claiming a visiting ability, and to visit anyone while implementing this strategy would be suicide if you&#8217;ve been lying. If there is another mafia they can just lie low until we start lynching again, then lynch peter.</p>
<p>next on my lynch list is Jeff, so maybe it&#8217;s worth testing him first, but it relies on the assumption that recruits do lose their powers and that peter wasn&#8217;t recruited sat the last moment.</p>
<p>I think in the end we still have to play some mind games anyway, so we may as well lynch. But I could be convinced otherwise.</p>

"<p>Well, we cant be certain. BUT if we kill manuel, then we wont be in the risky situation where mafia can kill someone and cause the cult to win. A night kill will reveal the existance of the mafia, and hopefully, we have enough information by then to find out who it is.</p>

<p>1. There are no mafia alive and<br />

"<p>Also, Since the night ended early, everyone must have used thier night abilities.<br />
Since Peter claims Manuel didnt use an ability, then theres 3 possibilities:</p>
<p>1. Cult cannot use night abilities<br />
2. Manuel chose not to use his night ability<br />
3. Peter is Lying</p>
<p>Manuel claimed to be going to help us, he would have used his night ability. Since he didnt, 2 is probably wrong. Which also supports him lying about his previous claim that cult keep thier abilities.</p>
<p>Peter is very likely to be a townie, so therefore he would not lie. If he did lie and is cult, he is putting himself against a fellow cult, who was attempting to use a strategy to keep him and the cult alive, which also seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Therefore I believe the cult do not keep thier night abilities.</p>

Madeline and Peter, can both target people who claim to have night abilities. Ask the people they targeted (and didnt target) the following day what they did and who they used it on. Depending on thier answer, we can confirm who is lying and who is telling the truth.</p>
<p>What we could also do, if we make a rule at the start of the next day to not vote for anyone, and forcing a tie. Any vote against anyone will be seen as an act by a cult. This should hopefully allow us to get multiple nights in without deaths, and therfore learn more information using madeline and Peter as above.since manuel will have been dead, we wont be on the cusp of losing to the cult, so we can take such risks.</p>

Case 1.

So I dont think they would do this.</p>
<p>Case 2: I could vote with them and cause a town vote, but first they would need to reveal themselves&#8230;inwhich case I would then just side with the townies and kill the cult and win&#8230;So they wont do that either.</p>

<p>1. There are 4 cult recruits, Beth isn&#8217;t one of them. Cult vote as a block, Beth jumps on their band wagon handing them both the win.</p>
<p>2. There are 4 cult recruits including Beth. Cult vote one way, town another, infinite tied vote, game ends in a tie.</p>

I think its more likely that the mafia themselves cant be tracked when they kill someone, otherwise, at the start of a game, if Peter had tracked someone who was killed, would he learn of Every Mafia player? Of course not, it would probably be standard that the mafia are untracked, unless they used a different unique ability themselves.</p>

Including voting patterns, and what that might mean,  I also feel that when you compare what we know there are other people who are more suspicious than i am. My feeling though is that If share all my suspicions, because I have already been targeted it will create a bandwagon effect resulting in my death, allowing the non-townies further benefits. </p>
<p>Also can someone explain this ninja theory to me, Im not quite certain what it is, also because everything seems to be balanced, what would the opposite role be. </p>
<p>If there was a way to whipper it to you I actually came up with a way to draw the mafia out of hiding but once they are aware of it, its easy to defeat, cuz why would they do something that would draw suspicion on themselves and it would also identify who the trustworthy people were.

<p>And I trust @Peter completely at this stage. Guys, confirmed townie by our sane detective with no chance of a bus drive. Revealed Cynthia was lying. The only way he can be lying is if he was last night&#8217;s cult recruit, in which case he still wants to reveal who the mafia was if he can. </p>
<p>@Victoria&#8217;s theory of a ninja is very interesting. it would explain why peter couldn&#8217;t tell who attacked Cynthia last night. It would also explain Paul&#8217;s townie status if he is mafia like I suspect.</p>
<p>We Don&#8217;t know what the wrong information was, just that it was sent. It could be that it was forgotten manuel was insane, forgotten paul appeared counter to his actual alignment, out it could&#8217;ve been wrong information about who else is in the cult. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if this seems like I&#8217;m attacking you Paul, but I was already suspicious of you and the confusion over manuel&#8217;s claimed investigation hasn&#8217;t really lowered them in anyway.</p>

"<p>Heidi and Madeline, I was responding to what I viewed as suspicious behaviour in your playing. I have a similar write up for all players .I was voting for Jeff because he seems the most suspicious to me as a cult or mafia member. I am still going to vote what I think is in the towns best interest, cause I am townie. I am also amused by this misbelief that I would somehow gain the powers of anther person if I was mafia. Under that logic there would now be a new cult leader. Which I really really hope there isn&#8217;t. Like I said though I know I am not mafia, I&#8217;m not sure where this hatred comes from, I think it stems from my repeated questioning and challenging of self described leaders. But look how that turned out Gine, Charles, Cynthia and Ernest were all bad people. I was wrong about Carlos. </p>
<p>I do think Manuel and his cult friends are still playing a game in the pursuit of their own win. To do so otherwise would violate the spirit of the game. We must always look underneath the underneath.</p>
<p>I do find Clarences one off kill interesting as an ability. If the powers of the godkilled are shared than it stands to reason that we would have numerous other powers we don&#8217;t know about shared. Like Debbies and Molly&#8217;s.</p>

All he would have to do is  make us vote for one wrong person and it will give the cult the advantage they need.</p>

A) they are Mafia, and there will be not kill in the night and we will still be ahead. We then vote Manuel the next day, and then it should be 7 left with 3 cul at most.</p>

"<p>I find it really interesting that everyone has assumed I&#8217;m cult, but then moved on to try and lynch other people. Seeing as from this point I actually can&#8217;t win I&#8217;m not even going to try to pretend that I didn&#8217;t get converted. But I was a late convert, so I&#8217;d still rather the town wins over the mafia.<br />
On which note, I figure I may as well go for full disclosure on how the cult works, because otherwise you guys may get the wrong idea. Apparently the role blockers have been awesome at picking in this game, because when I got converted there was only Cynthia, Charles, and then me. So as I said, I can&#8217;t win as there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to get a majority unless for some reason it gets down to a ridiculously small number of people, me included, which seems unlikely as you all know I&#8217;m cult. But the reason I would suggest you don&#8217;t kill me now is that I&#8217;m not a threat, but I can still help in the cause to get rid of the mafia. Turns out you don&#8217;t lose your night ability when you get converted, so I can still investigate. Then you guys can all lynch me once the mafia is dead if you feel so inclined&#8230;<br />
Therefore, as I feel like it&#8217;s in the town&#8217;s interests to work with me, I&#8217;m going to go ahead and act like a townie in terms of working out who the mafia is.<br />
I&#8217;m still inclined to believe Heidi is townie, as she obviously didn&#8217;t get converted and was neutral when I investigated her, but I&#8217;m not sure enough about anyone else to assume they aren&#8217;t just mafia playing a really clever game. For example, the thought occurs to me that Madeleine is a role blocker, but we don&#8217;t know 100% that she&#8217;s town-aligned. I&#8217;d believe that she is for now though. Paul seems like town from my results, but there&#8217;s been speculation about him having some Godfather-like ability to appear town, and there is the fact that Peter apparently couldn&#8217;t identify the killer &#8211; that seems like an easy way to claim a night ability he doesn&#8217;t have, because he knew Cynthia had died, unless we have an explanation for that? OR Paul could have some sort of cool ability and be the mafia who got Cynthia.<br />
I&#8217;m still undecided about Victoria, Jeff and Beth, although they all seem relatively legitimate claims. Clarence I think is straight up dodgy.<br />

",False
"<p>I believe Cynthia was targetted Twice by Madeline for Jailing, bringing it down to 3 (Confirm Madeline?) . BUT, we started with 1 cult on day 1 (the leader), so that bring it back up to 4.</p>
<p>We know Manuel is cult, so kill him. Then the mafia will kill one at night, so we will be left with 7 people, 1 Mafiia, 3 Cult (at most) so once again we need to kill the cult, or we lose. Then it will be 5 total, 2 cult and 1 mafia.</p>
<p>We would need to repeat this, keeping the mafia alive, and wait for the mafia to kill a cult by accident.<br />
This will also give the mafia the oportunity to kill off our important players.</p>
<p>I think killing the mafia now is the best bet. If we are right, then they wont kill in the night, and the ratio will be 4 out of 8 (at worst). If we are wrong, the mafia either kill the cult ( and we will be back where we were a day before, or he kills a townie and the cult win.</p>

",True
"<p>Which is very true, but we also need to consider the numbers of cult as well, once the mafia is gone. If the cult is the majority than they still win. I think there are 1-2, most likely 1, mafia left and 8 of us. Of the up to 9 cult members there could be we have killed 4, with one night of Cynthia being incarcerated by madeline. That brings the existing cult as high as 4, which by logical math means that if we fail to lynch a cult member, than they have the majority unless the remaining mafia member kills a cult person. So we are not safe yet. If we fuck this up it could actually be last night of the game. Though I want the mafia dead, its not quite time to focus on them because if we do so, the town loses. Personally id prefer to see 2 more dead cultists so we have a margin of error, but we for sure need at least 1 more dead.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the assumption for the rest of the post. I&#8217;m telling the truth and have been the whole time.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what we know. </p>
<p>Peter is Townie and telling the truth. There is no way he reveals what he did yesterday unless he has been telling the truth the whole time. </p>
<p>Manuel was recruited night 8. He is not to be trusted any more. Before this he was likely telling the truth. This means Heidi&#8217;s result of Neutral is likely true, so</p>
<p>Heidi is either telling the truth or she is a third party serial killer who&#8217;s goal is to kill everybody. </p>
<p>Given Manuel&#8217;s conversion the same night, Paul&#8217;s result is suspicious. The mod confirmation of wrong information is interesting. Even as a cult recruit Manuel has incentive to reveal the mafia.</p>
<p>I incarcerated Cynthia twice. So out or 9 nights she could recruit 7. Let&#8217;s assume she was also unable to recruit last night (not necessarily true). So there are 6 possible recruits and we&#8217;ve killed 3 of them. so there are up to 3-4 recruits remaining. Since the cultists haven&#8217;t died with their leader, I assume they can still win on their own and just can&#8217;t recruit any more. </p>
<p>My Speculation:</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice I urged Clarence and Beth to vote with me for Cynthia. This is because I believed their claims. There is little reason to believe Clarence and no reason to believe Beth but I do. Please feel free to disagree with me. Beth I would like you to explain your rapid vote changing towards the end of the day that lead to a no lynch. It could be evidence that your are a cult recruit. You did vote for Cynthia at some points so I don&#8217;t think so. </p>
<p>I believe Jeff is telling the truth about being white mage but is a cult recruit. This is mostly speculation but I&#8217;m acting on that assumption.</p>
<p>Victoria is likely telling the truth. She could be a cult recruit but I doubt it given her willingness to vote for Cynthia early in the day, but she did also unvote quite early. I could go either way. </p>
<p>Paul is either the mafia or a cult recruit. There is evidence for both. He praised Cynthia at the beginning of the day yesterday. Manuel was a recruit while discussing his results of Paul. As I said it&#8217;s in the cult&#8217;s interest to reveal the mafia. So metagame reasons of wrong information and general scummyness of play (and I will use that word Paul) indicate he is the best lynch target. </p>
<p>I believe the best course of action right now is to lynch Paul. If we&#8217;re wrong, I think the best next target for the killer is Heidi. I will incarcerate her in the night. If I die, I was wrong, she is cleared and Beth and Clarence should be you next targets. </p>

"<p>And just to clarify I only plan on changing my vote if it is because people find Clarence a better option. I find them equal</p>
",True
"<p>@Cynthia, the problem is your plan only works if you are telling the truth. I don&#8217;t hate it, but this is going to be a post of following the logic to it&#8217;s furthest conclusion. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re telling the truth, you sacrifice your shield and prove your townie claim. </p>
<p>But you state the reason that you didn&#8217;t want to disclose your full role is because you believe that recruits keep their powers. Meaning if I&#8217;m correct that at least one of Jeff or Victoria has been converted you can protect yourself that way. </p>
<p>So if cult recruits keep their powers you could still be leader or telling the truth. You&#8217;re unlikely to be a cult recruit unless you are willing trying to sacrifice yourself by leading a mislynch against a non cult to hand the actual cult leader the win</p>
<p>If cult recruits don&#8217;t keep their powers, then you are probably telling the truth, or the aforementioned cult recruit trying to lead a mislynch.</p>
<p>But if cultist don&#8217;t keep their powers you are no more likely to be recruited than any other. Of course we don&#8217;t know, so it&#8217;s a legitimate worry.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know wether to support your plan or not, but on the fear that I&#8217;m wrong about recruits keeping their powers then the only way to kill you as cult leader is during the day, I&#8217;ll maintain my vote for now. I too fear the bandwagon. You are right, your play day one is strong evidence for being the bulletproof townie. </p>
<p>Now Victoria is currently voting for you. This means either I&#8217;m wrong about you, because I don&#8217;t think a cultist will bus the leader. Other cultists yes, but if they&#8217;re away from the computer at the wrong time we might get an early lynch and they&#8217;re screwed.  Or I&#8217;m wrong about Victoria and she hasn&#8217;t been cult recruited. If this is true it means you losing your shield on night 6 is unlikely as Victoria claims to have protected you that night with 75% effectiveness. Not impossible, just unlikely.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my main assumption: If the cult recruits keep their powers, they don&#8217;t control the killer, otherwise Charles wouldn&#8217;t have died in the night. Also there is only one killer, probably mafia.</p>
<p>Now as I&#8217;ve stated, the problem to solve at the moment is that there are two people lying about their role, and I believe if we find one, finding the other is easier.  The advantage is the mafia know who they are and so they know half the solution. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the Mafia as I hope I&#8217;ve demonstrated by now</p>
<p>Peter is not the mafia, as confirmed by Max and that the knowledge he has is difficult to fake as mafia.</p>
<p>Manuel isn&#8217;t the mafia .The information he has can be faked as a mafia. But unless Jeff or Victoria claims to have protected Heidi night 7, his visiting role is not lethal. Also, I could be wrong, but to fake an insane cop is unlikely.  </p>
<p>Jeff and Victoria are unlikely to be the mafia. I&#8217;m assuming not for the rest of the post. </p>
<p>Cynthia is not the mafia. Incarcerated on a night when a death occurred. </p>
<p>Clarence is unlikely to be the mafia. Claiming a one shot vig kill is risky unless you can talk to the actual killer. Since I&#8217;m assuming a lone killer and that the cult doesn&#8217;t control the killer, then you couldn&#8217;t know you&#8217;d be safe claiming the kill. If you are the mafia, then someone else killed someone night 5. This may be Heidi telling the truth about her role but lying about still having a kill, or someone else is lying. You know wether Cynthia is telling the truth or not about night 6, follow the logic below. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume Clarence is telling the truth though.</p>
<p>Heidi. Possible mafia but unlikely, if we believe Manuel then a neutral role has been confirmed. Cult leader could turn up as neutral rather than cult but that&#8217;s speculation. She&#8217;s more likely to be lying if she is cult leader rather than mafia and using a converted Manuel to protect her.</p>
<p>Paul could be mafia if as Cynthia suggested you have taken over the godfather role and appear town aligned. (this could explain the mods making a mistake) If you are mafia you know if Cynthia is telling the truth or not because you either shot her night 6 or you didn&#8217;t . Vote for her if she&#8217;s lying and if she&#8217;s telling the truth I&#8217;d look at Heidi or Beth. </p>
<p>Beth could be the mafia, there is no evidence one way or the other on her. Same logic as Paul, you know whether or not Cynthia is telling the truth about being shot or not. If lying vote for her, if truth vote Heidi as most likely and Paul as much less likely.</p>
<p>I discounted Victoria and Jeff from the analysis for claiming healing roles. I think Jeff is probably telling the truth since he claimed day 1. But&#8230;</p>
<p>If we lynch Cynthia and she&#8217;s a cult recruit there&#8217;s a chance Victoria is the Leader. I think one of the Heidi, Beth Paul trio is more likely (depending on if you believe Manuel is still unrecruited). However Victoria set up a nurse claim day two. She could be telling the truth. But she could&#8217;ve been setting up a viable role claim, and is now bussing one of her recruits to seal the deal. Like I said, I think it&#8217;s unlikely but it&#8217;s one of the things I&#8217;m thinking about. </p>
<p>Like I said, we&#8217;re trying to find two liars. Cynthia your plan can&#8217;t find both of them, and relies on you telling the truth or recruits not keeping their powers. And we can&#8217;t know that either of those assumptions are good.</p>

<p>As for voting, we need to start now to avoid the bandwagon lynch. </p>
<p>Now I previously stated I like Clarence or Paul because of their weak role claims. I don&#8217;t believe Clarences only role was to have one kill on Day 6. Not when he&#8217;s the only Vanilla role. Also he said he was Bart did he not? Why did not die when Lisa did? That&#8217;s how siblings always operates.. </p>

"<p>Paul&#8217;s roleclaim is dreamer. He sees any mafia who targets him in the night (excluding killing actions).</p>
<p>I said it was weird because it seems like a fairly ridiculous roleclaim &#8211; there are only two roles it would affect (roleclaimer and silencer) and attracting their attention would also likely attract the attention of killing roles.</p>
<p>He will not claim his Simpsons name because he fears Clarence has a role that needs Simpsons names.</p>
<p>Manuel&#8217;s finding does murky things but then it does make sense if he inherited the Godfather title (Godfather generally has to the one to deliver the mafia&#8217;s kill to the mods, so it makes sense that someone would take it over &#8211; especially if Godkilled). There are other mechanics that would make this possible.</p>
<p>So the poor roleclaim indicates mafia or cult leader. The possibility of a miller role indicats Godfather (but then perhaps Cult leader has been granted the Godfather ability to always look innocent considering how big the game is?). These are both legitimate but non-confirmed concerns.</p>
<p>From a worst case scenario perspective, if we take him at his word, Paul is the least valuable  townie as he has no useful ability. The same can be said of Clarence. If he is lying, we get something. There is also the possibility that he is recruited so more possibility. Decent possibility.</p>

<p>In any case, can I take the fact that you did not counter-vote me as evidence that you are satisfied that I am town? This is of interest to me.</p>

"<p>Why I do understand your reasoning of &#8220;kill beth, because we cant lose&#8221; the fact is you can lose.</p>
<p>If I were cult, I would not choose to role claim a role such as Survivor. One were it puts me in a position where noone is my ally. I would have gone with something townie based, with an ability that is easily untrackable.</p>
<p>I would also be a really dumb target for cult leader to recruit. I have no special abilities AND I already said that I would prefer them to win (from a game perspective, Ive changed that now however, since I think the townies stand a better chance. It would be an absolute waste for them to recruit me.</p>
<p>I am niether mafia nor Cult. And since you said our main role is to kill Cult leader, then cult and , followed by mafia. An unaligned target would be just as bad a lynch as a townie. </p>
<p>If you believe that I am the Survivor, then lynching me is not the best option right now. If you dont believe my claim of survivor. I can highlight my previous behaviour to demonstate to you that I am telling the truth.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out, that yesterday, Charles (cult recruit) had attempted to get my lynched, He know that I was an &#8216;enemy&#8217; to everyone, and would still contribute to improving the cults-townie ratio if I died. This would make me an easy target to get eveyrone to bandwagon onto. His accusations were also unprovoked by anyone but himself.</p>
<p>You also claim I roleclaimed last, this is certainly not the case. You role claimed after me I believe, and so did several others.</p>
",True
"<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>First point, basically everyone in the game at the moment has said they are suspicious of me or even voted for me. If I am cult leader, or even cult, where is my support?</p>
<p>The fact that Charles was so vocal shows why it&#8217;s again not me. It&#8217;d be idiotic for us to link arms and be so obviously connected while such big targets.</p>
<p>Hell, on the first day of this game, I voted without reasoning at 11.59. It was so suspicious that I nearly got voted out the next day and Madeline herself thought I was in enough danger that she should incarcerate me for protection. Why would I act like that? </p>
<p>1. Would I act like that as cult leader? Absolutely not.<br />
2. Would I act like that given that I am the bulletproof townie? Absolutely. The whole point of the role is having some form of immunity. I can afford to be a bigger target.</p>
<p>What I believe is that there is a problem with the investigation results.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you believe of my guilt or innocence, I think that Manuel being an insane cop does not explain all of the results. What is quite possible is this: That the remaining mafia has assumed the role of the Godfather, and as such, will always appear town. That gives us extra options.</p>
<p>In any case, we are most likely in LyLo, so this discussion is largely academic. If you lynch me, given that I will flip townie, it is going to be hard to get through tonight. We need a good kill.</p>
<p>Hence my suggestion is this.</p>
<p>We aim for cult leader/cultist tonight. Despite my misgivings, we leave Heidi alone, simply so that she can have her kill. We also leave the mafia alone for the same reason. Essentially, if we do not hit cult leader with one of these kills, we lose. I would ask in that circumstance that we lynch someone else likely to be cult.</p>
<p>My reasoning is this: There is only one way to tell if I am telling the truth. Attack me in the night. I tell you now, I will not die if I use my shield. That way, you can confirm my identity without lynching incorrectly. If I am cult leader, I will die anyway and won&#8217;t get to recruit. </p>
<p>This is an annoying last resort because I would have hoped that you could tell that I am not cult leader by now but here we are. I say we do not target mafia this round, simply because we need their kill in addition to Heidi&#8217;s this round to stem the tide should we mislynch.</p>
<p>In regards to Heidi; I don&#8217;t think that was the best explanation but then I am getting from your attitude that you also don&#8217;t really think that I am cult myself. This may because you are cult and know, or simply because you are reading that despite some strange gameplay. In any case, attack me tonight if you want confirmation, but I think you know that your bullet could be expended elsewhere more fruitfully.</p>
<p>In regards to who to lynch today if you can see the logic in my plan. There are a few options. I am inclined to go with Beth but essentially will follow the flow. I do not like voting for someone else &#8220;just because&#8221;, but I personally obviously know that anyone else is less likely to be town than I am.</p>
<p>Very quickly:</p>
<p>- Jeff: Probably either cult leader (did not save Charles because he couldn&#8217;t. His ability has always seemed overpowered) or is telling the truth. Probably not convert because of way he latched onto Charles.</p>
<p>- Paul: Probably either mafia (showed up as townie because of a miller/godfather effect, weak roleclaim), cult leader (similar reasoning, was heavily bussed by Charles) or telling the truth (Argument with Charles also possibly real). Likely not convert.</p>
<p>- Beth: Probably cult leader (Role-claimed last and chose a role that would never be targeted &#8211; we lose if we do not kill cultists so it is nobodys interest to attack her). Possible truth but that would be problematic otherwise. Also possibly cult. Hence my best bet.</p>
<p>- Madeline: Town. Possible convert.</p>
<p>- Manuel: As above.</p>
<p>- Peter: As above but in my mind, a higher chance of convert. Still only a chance.</p>
<p>- Victoria: Not mafia. Role-claim was set up too well and too early. May indicate cult leader in that she thought so far ahead but likely is townie. Potential recruit in that she is a healing position and is on the bandwagon against me.</p>
<p>- Heidi: Have gone over before. Could essentially be any alignment. In the current circumstances, probably a bad lynch choice so tonight should be illuminating. Suggest that Peter follow Heidi if both alive.</p>
<p>- Clarence: Also wildcard. Potential recruit for reasons I stated in earlier days (potential vigilante powers). Makes weird statements about Rosie and has a Vanilla position which seems weird. Could be anything.</p>
<p>If I forgot anyone, they are probably not at the front of my radar.</p>
<p>In any case, please really read the stuff I have written. To the townies who suspect it is me, note that you are likely in the company of cult. Note that this is the ballgame we are talking about here. Like on Day 2 when I drew heaps of attention to myself then, hopefully this post shows the truth through full candour. And yes, while it may have made even more enemies through my guesses and inferences, note that that is a sign of a townie. A scum will try and avoid any disputes. A townie won&#8217;t care what it makes them look like if they get to the town.</p>
<p>As such, I suggest lynching the person who:</p>
<p>1. In my analysis seems the best bet.<br />
2. If they are NOT cult, it matters the least (Survivor does not help us in any way because the cult are trying to outnumber the town).</p>
<p>I of course refer to (Lady Mac)Beth.</p>
<p>If we do something like that, then we can put into action a plan that will see me vindicated tonight. If you kill me, when I flip townie, you will have no way of confirming the identity of anyone else. This is our best bet.</p>

Also Victoria and Jeff if they can save recruits. But if they were all recruits and there&#8217;s a leader out there as well we would&#8217;ve lost by now, so at least some and possibly all of them are telling the truth, depending on how smart the cult leader has been with recruiting &#8211; they may have recruited on completely different logic.<br />

Ok. I will clarify. My early post did say I was Town aligned with a night ability that wouldnt effect the game. And a later one saying it was a powerful ability and that i am unaligned. If you look closely in the middle you might also notice that i had issues working out what it all meant too.<br />
I am unaligned with my own win condition.<br />
My night ability, to me, seemed useless at first. This was until the cult appeared and I realised I could have a large impact on the game.<br />
IF I do not use my night ability wisely, I lose it. And then I become town aligned and win when the town does.<br />
If I role reveal I feel the cult will target me for lynching today.</p>
<p>Whats wrong with us boosting the ranks of the townies? Sides you still get a chance to use the shot. Based upon information given you can be fairly certain the leader is not myself, manuel, madeline or yourself. That brings it to a 1 in 5 shot. Take into account Beth claim as another neutral in the survivor moleman, 1 in 4. Sides it will prove your worth as a townie. Unless you want to role claim as the mafia which you could also be. Ability to kill in the night, but wanting to ensure survival against cult, makes you unique and able to survive. That could be why your saying there would be only one kill at night. </p>

"<p>@Beth:</p>
<p>Despite what has been said (largely by others who I suspect are cult, in a manner to detract suspicion from them), it is normal that cultists retain their roles. What changes is their win condition. As such, I didn&#8217;t want the cult to have a recruit who wouldn&#8217;t turn up dead in the morning. At this stage, everyone has a 10% chance of dying in the night except for me. For that reason, a cult leader would be inclined to recruit me, simply because they could use that to ensure their numbers. They probably only need 1 or 2 more anyway so a solid recruit could end the game. </p>
<p>In regards to your second point, I have long argued against full role-claiming and did so to the minimal extent that would give value. Hopefully the fact that my Simpsons fora matches my active ability lends some credence. The value of not claiming comes in that it made my role seemed less valuable and as such less of a target. Further, I believe there are several more people that have more to their role than they are saying/know.</p>
<p>==== </p>
<p>Here is some of the most damning evidence against Heidi in my opinion. From Day 7:</p>
<p>Heidi:<br />
&#8220;My night ability, to me, seemed useless at first. This was until the cult appeared and I realised I could have a large impact on the game.<br />
IF I do not use my night ability wisely, I lose it. And then I become town aligned and win when the town does.&#8221;</p>
<p>If her aim is to kill the cult leader, how would it seem useless? It would seem hard but you would obviously know what the ability. Seriously consider it. Her ability as she describes it is &#8220;You get one shot to kill the cult leader, otherwise you win with town.&#8221;</p>
<p>1. How could she NOT know that there is a cult? ( &#8220;That was until the cult appeared&#8221;).<br />
2. How could she NOT realise the use? (The use is exactly what it says it does.<br />
3. Why did she use such weird language at the end? &#8220;IF I do not use my night ability wisely, I lose it&#8221;? She gets to use her claimed ability once regardless. </p>
<p>Clearly, the role she claimed differed in practice from the one she prepared. She spent time claiming and making it lavish &#8220;I am Herman, I have one arm&#8221;, However, the fact is that what she said simply does not match what someone with that role would say. The role does not exist.</p>
<p>If you have more doubts, have a read through Day 7 and 8 with particular regard to Heidi. It&#8217;s all over the place. She initially claims to have not used her shot but then admits she tried when Max says I was unlocatable (trying to engender innocence &#8211; for the record, I&#8217;d assume that &#8220;one shot&#8221; would still go even if you miss). She then says it would be suicide for the cult to recruit her as she would know who the leader is and kill them, even though that is a ridiculous assertion (did the mafia aligned Fred kill the leader?). She then even spruiks no lynch! No lynch at this stage would be a disaster for town. Finally, she starts buddying me as one of the more vocal townies to try and get through another night.</p>
<p>In essence, I think the answer is pretty clear and would love to be vindicated. I would love a response that is more than mocking me about her non-existent role but then, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Keep vote.</p>
",True
"<p>Well. Cynthias last post has brought more speculation as to her being cult leader.<br />
Asking to be jailed makes no sense, the general concensus is that you lose night abilities when you become culted, so the cult gain nothing from recruiting you (You protect from being night killed, they dont kill at night so you arnt a threat anyways).<br />
If you do keep your abilities, theres plenty of other people with better roles for them to recruit. I think your request to be jailed is because you fear dying tonight from either Mafia or Heidi (since she has suggested it earlier, and hence your accusation for her).</p>
<p>You origiinally said your role was the Bulletproof Townie, which was believable. If you had more to your role, why would you hide it, I cant see that much of an advantage to it. It seems more likely that you were caught visiting someone else of a night time, and therefore had to adjust your fake role to something with a night target. It just seems like youve only updated your information when something new come up that challenges what youve previously said (like being jailed night 1)</p>
<p>Also, since Cynthia has been jailed twice,(and hence lost 2 night actions)  this might explain why the recruit numbers have been so low. (since we know charles couldnt protect against cult, it was only Madeline and Christy who could stop it. And they should have won by now if they could recruit every night)</p>

Plus, as I hadn&#8217;t yet role revealed, I couldn&#8217;t argue with him, and he and Madeline both said they trusted you and since they were the ones not out to have me killed, I thought I&#8217;d listen to them on this occasion.<br />

"<p>Okay so I am going to have to fully claim but I am doing this on the understanding that I am incarcerated tonight.</p>
<p>There is one part about my role I did not reveal before &#8211; My bulletproof status is described as &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Love&#8221;. Each night I have a choice to target someone else to join me in my protection My shield only activates when I target someone else &#8211; if I do not, then neither of us gain bulletproof status. If either of us are targeted during that night, I lose the shield but the targeted player survives.</p>
<p>The reason for withholding this is very simple &#8211; I still have my shield.</p>
<p>By saying this, I am the cult&#8217;s number 1 recruit &#8211; I can not yet die in the night, I can also be used to protect the leader. As such, I repeat my request that I am incarcerated tonight to ensure I am not recruited.</p>
<p>I have avoided using it when being ostensibly saved by doctors, because the night deaths have given us more information, and using it only increases risk to me. I used it last night on Manuel because he is the one I trust the most and has the most valuable role. Further, the fact that he identified Paul today as townie without prompting leads me to further believe he is not cult.</p>
<p>@Clarence: Well if Rosie was unaware she was a death miller, perhaps that answers your question. You and Rosie are the only two vanilla roles in the game so far and you were informed by the mods of this on her death? This suggests that you have a role that you are unaware of. Perhaps the opposite of Rosie &#8211; she appeared mafia but didn&#8217;t know she actually wasn&#8217;t. Maybe you are the opposite? In any case, if I were in the cult with you I would be telling you to shut up and stop drawing attention to yourself for no reason from a wrong claim. So unless you are amazing, I doubt it is real.</p>
<p>@InregardstoJeff: It is certainly possible but then that would indicate very poor play from Jeff. He has jumped on essentially every single Charles bandwagon. I think the fact that he did not save Charles last night also works in his favour.From my reading, the cult roles say &#8216;cult recruited doctor, etc, which seems to mean they retain their roles and simply change their alignment.</p>
<p>That being said, I am near inclined to give him my vote on the balance of probabilities but will wait for other accusations.</p>
<p>I am least convinced of the claims by Heidi and Beth. Out of those, I believe Beth&#8217;s role-claim to be the stronger. Heidi&#8217;s claim is awkward as it is premised on an extremely narrow win-condition (to take out the cult leader, with one bullet, on one night). If she misses, she can win as a town? What that says is that her role is essentially a one hit vigilante with an extra win condition? It just seems very awkward.</p>
<p>The other claim I find suspicious is Victoria. My reasoning behind this is fairly narrow. She claims that she was &#8220;highly suspicious&#8221; of me, but then she stated that she saved me a couple of nights ago. Why would you save someone you are suspicious of?</p>
<p>In all honesty, I would be willing to vote for basically anyone mentioned in Paul&#8217;s post (except, ironically, probably not Peter for now). I say this because, while I believe one of them is cult leader, in all likelihood, several of them are cult.</p>
<p>I think that is the right direction.</p>
<p>P.S. I did not receive a message the other night when I was incarcerated as I did not use my ability. However, I can confirm that I did indeed receive confirmation I had been sent to prison on Day 1 when I tried to use my ability. As such, I confirm Madeline&#8217;s role.</p>

"<p>As said by the Mods. Charles: &#8220;The doctor was able to save a player from dying or silencing in the night&#8221; Mentions nothing of being able to protect from cult.<br />
I assume this rumor was either an attempt to make us believe he couldn&#8217;t be converted thus protecting him from lynching, or he did this to make the cult think whoever he targeted was protected from being converted to give himself more power over them.</p>
<p>Cynthia does raise alarms and is a possible Cult leader. Madeline&#8217;s post hints at this also, and she has provided some very good, logical arguments.</p>
<p>Charles would have thought he was very safe, and highly unlikely to die. He also said for Jeff to protect him and that he would protect Jeff. I get the feeling he did this so the mafia would not target him of Jeff in the night. Since we now know Charles is Cult, it hints that Jeff is also cult. There is also the suggestion that once you become Culted, you no longer have your night abilities. This would mean Jeff was also not able to protect, and hence why Charles died to a night kill. (that was really badly said, but it makes sense in my mind. Pretty much, Jeff is also cult, not leader but).</p>
<p>So we have fairly good confirmation about a lot of the characters roles. Would someone be able to post Max&#8217;s night targets, and also Manuel would you be able to post all of yours so we can analyse them? Thanks!</p>
<p>I said I was going to sit back and not accuse as it would cause people to suspect me of trying to have the game end quickly. However, I (and most of us) believed we were at the brink of the cult gaining majority, I now however feel this is not the case. I think there is probably around 1 mafia remaining, and once we kill the cult leader (which we are very close to) it should be an easy victory for townies.</p>

"<p>Real life calls and I won&#8217;t be around towards the end of voting, so I&#8217;d like to get some other opinions on what I&#8217;m thinking &#8211; at this stage, if Paul is clear then the two people who seem the most suss to me are Clarence and Peter. Although if the cult are playing strategically (and they seem to have done so by recruiting Charles if he was able to save people from being culted) then I would think they&#8217;d keep going along those lines and recruit the people who have abilities that can be used against them. For example Madeleine, who can incarcerate people to stop them being recruited, or Heidi, who is out to get the cult leader. I haven&#8217;t worked out who would be the most likely, but all of those options make logical sense as recruits. Clarence could even be leader, as he hasn&#8217;t claimed any special abilities, which as he points out is weird and unlikely in this game.</p>

It was given to me the same night I was given a one off vigilante kill. Unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t seem to be useful since we are dealing with cult more than mafia.</p>
<p>One point in favour of my innocence is that as soon as I was first voted for I proceeded to make available all the information that I had. As a townie, it was in my interests for fellow townies to have verified information if I died (and was thus confirmed town). If I was anything other than town aligned and had information that would help the town it would be in my interest to keep it quiet so that my non-town side (wether mafia or cult) would have a better chance of winning.</p>

Also, I would find you rather suspicious given how much Charles advocated your innocence, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re cult because Charles would probably have been much too clever for that. I actually thought I&#8217;d have been recruited by now, but my role is pretty useless at the moment. No one&#8217;s shooting at townies, and I don&#8217;t know who they are anymore if they were.</p>
<p>@Paul. Firstly, Charles didn&#8217;t move to have me protected. He left me to protect myself, which, incidentally, I did not. Also, according strictly to your own theories, the cult recruits by knowing people&#8217;s simpsons character.

"<p>@Victoria, I would like to explain my actions of the past few nights, although i will lose some advantage by doing that. As you may recall, the few nights before last night, my instructions were to alternately save Charles and myself, thus ensuring the survival of the townies few remaining protecting abilities. I don&#8217;t think anyone picked up on that, but I&#8217;m sure i said I can&#8217;t actually self save. I decided it was in the towns interests for me to survive, so I didn&#8217;t bring this up, and instead opted to save someone else that I was very confident was townie. This would mean my own survival, and that of someone else, effectively meaning i could save three people. Now, since for this to work I had to &#8220;flip a coin&#8221; to decide who I would save, and not say who it was, I didn&#8217;t, but this gave me problems last night. It worked out that the night before last, I had saved Charles, so couldn&#8217;t save him last night. This meant that he had a 50-50 chance of surviving last night, which evidently he did not.<br />
Of course, we also found out that he was actually cult, which surprised me as much as the next person. I had also believed in his &#8220;non-cultable&#8221; status, so seeing that he actually was shocked me. It was because of my belief in his not being able to be recruited that I voted with him in the later days, earlier I voted with him because I didn&#8217;t know who else to believe. Now that its been confirmed he was cult, I have no idea what to think any more.<br />
I hope this has answered your question to your satisfaction. let me know if theres anything else you want to know.</p>

"<p>Ok here&#8217;s what we know:</p>
<p>1. Max was telling the truth. (sorry Max)</p>
<p>2. Therefore Peter is town sided given his Night 6 Investigation.</p>
<p>3. It implies Peter is therefore also telling the truth. </p>
<p>I have claimed Jailkeeper. I Incarcerated Manuel night 6 and Cynthia night 7.</p>
<p>Night 7 has been confirmed (as best as these things can be) by Max&#8217;s failure to find Cynthia.</p>
<p>From this we get:</p>
<p>4. Cynthia is not a killing role, or the only killing role as she was incarcerated and Christy died.</p>
<p>5. Manuel has a visiting role, that is unlikely to be lethal. He&#8217;s claimed Detective. We can confirm this by his knowledge that he was incarcerated night 6 and Peter finding that he visited Heidi, who did not die, night 7.</p>
<p>There is lot&#8217;s of evidence to support Manuel telling the truth, and that he&#8217;s an insane detective. All but confirmed by Marge&#8217;s post from the grave.</p>
<p>Given that.</p>
<p>6. Paul is telling the truth (I&#8217;m honestly surprised, sorry Paul)</p>
<p>7. Charles was cult recruited. We don&#8217;t know when.</p>
<p>&#8212; Speculations &#8212;</p>
<p>It was I who suggested that Charles may be an anti cult doctor. He thought it might be interesting be an interesting thought. Somewhere along the way he claimed he was probably un-cultable. I thought this highly unlikely given his previous claim that he was able to self heal. His confidence and continued claim could be read either as an explanation as to why he hadn&#8217;t been recruited or lies told by a recruit. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, this was obviously a mistake. So I think we can narrow down Charles&#8217; conversion to whenever he claimed the possibility of being unrecruitable. </p>
<p>Now something that made me suspicious, but not enough to say anything was Charles nightly protection plans. He told Jeff to protect himself. Jeff said on days 1 and 2 that he was unable to save himself. Jeff never corrected him. Jeff could&#8217;ve been doing this for deception as a townie, but I already suspected him of being recruited. And this just makes me more suspicious. </p>
<p>&#8212;- </p>
<p>There are at least 2 people lying. We have a Cult leader (Or else why would there be cultists) And we have someone who can Kill, either Mafia, Vigilante or Serial Killer. </p>
<p>Also the Cult Can&#8217;t have recruited everyday (unless one of the god killed players was cult and the mods didn&#8217;t tell us) or the game would be over. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the other Role blockers did, but as well as the confirmed incarcerations of Peter night 4, Manuel night 6 and Cynthia night 7 I can say I also incarcerated Cynthia night 1. She voted for a mafia in weird circumstances and I wanted to protect her from retribution.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m not going to be everyone&#8217;s most trusted player, leading the lynch on Carlos, essentially being on Max&#8217;s bandwagon and Charles all but requesting I be converted last night but I&#8217;m not the cult. </p>
<p>My best guess on who else might be though is Jeff and Victoria. Victoria hinted at the nurses role, and the Cult leader was willing to recruit Charles and might have wanted all the protective roles. She might have been soft claiming to feel out if there was a counterclaim to set up a safe place as leader, but I think she is probably just a recruit. Similarly I think Jeff was telling the truth about being white mage.</p>
<p>So who&#8217;s the leader, who&#8217;s the mafia?</p>
<p>Not peter, confirmed by Max<br />
Not Manuel, for reasons stated above,<br />
Not Myself, un-counterclaimed Jailkeeper, with verified results (even if you believe I&#8217;m a cultist, i&#8217;m not the leader)<br />
Not Paul, confirmed by Manuel</p>
<p>Unlikely to be Jeff, probable recruit.<br />
Unlikely to be Victoria, probable recruit.</p>
<p>Weird, Clarence. Claims an un counterclaimed one off vigilante kill. With just that information I would&#8217;ve believed him, but is now claiming knowledge of Rosie. I can only conclude he&#8217;s lying or cheating. </p>
<p>So that leaves me with the list of Heidi, Beth and Cynthia.</p>
<p>I actually believe Heidi, but there&#8217;s no real evidence to support her.</p>
<p>In my mind, Beth and Cynthia have some explaining to do. And I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing more from Victoria.</p>

<p>This would also explain Charles insistence that we all role reveal, I&#8217;m still not sure about his insistence thought that we reveal our simpsons names. Also once converted i think you lose your abilities. The only way to test would be for the mafia to kill Jeff, but if we fail to lynch a cult member today, the mafia has to kill the cult or they win. </p>

"<p>Bugger, I thought we had said at some point doctors couldn&#8217;t be culted? Or maybe just wanted to think that, that&#8217;s a bit disappointing. And means our theories about the cult leader might be completely wrong, because if doctors are able to save people from being culted, converting them is a really good strategy and probably not one a partly inexperienced player would have gone for. Continuing in that vein I would guess the next people to be targeted would be the roleblockers who can stop people being culted, so we need to be really careful now of who we trust.<br />
In terms of investigation, I found out something really useful last night in the context of the overall game, but not helpful about getting rid of cult. Paul is mafia. Which, by the way, makes your comment &#8220;thanks mafia for killing cult&#8221; kind of douche-y, but yes thank you. So the question then is whether we lynch him now that we know he&#8217;s mafia and a threat, or is he useful enough as a way to kill more cult that we should keep him? That also depends whether we have enough proof that someone else is cult to lynch them. I&#8217;d rather go for a definite lynch of someone we know is mafia rather than risk following my shoddy logic again and lynching another townie if we&#8217;re not completely sure (on which note, sorry Max, I genuinely thought you were being suss).</p>

"<p>Okay so I came online with a vote in mind but am thinking now I may have to reconsider.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the stories of Max, Peter and Paul are awkward and unconvincing (in ascending order). I also believe that Max and Manuel, as declared cops, are either possible covers for leaders or more likely, great recruits for cult (Follow the cop works a wonder).</p>
<p>So in that respect, I came online wanting to vote for Max as he is the one that fits into both categories. However, the number of votes he already has is slightly alarming.</p>
<p>That being said, if I may meta-game for a moment. The fact that there is a supposed &#8220;end-game&#8221; day coming up in over a week suggests to me that the cult is not on the cusp of winning. This may suggest that either the cult has been effectively blocked from recruiting, or more likely, has different rules to what we thought. E.G. They may only recruit every second night or even, they start off with a static number as a third major faction. </p>
<p>I am still not inclined to vote for Max as I am wary of the late bandwagon.</p>
<p>Picking up on what someone said earlier, (Madeline?), I think it is highly possible that Peter is the cult leader. If we take away his initial call about Carlos being silenced by Fred, then his actions and declarations have seemed very contradictory. That initial call is what has solidified his position. However, it must be remembered that the cult had a mafia recruit in Frank who could have simply informed Peter of this fact allowing for a fake-claim. That would explain the awkward way in which he announced it (I heard a rumour blah blah blah). The fact that this perfectly legitimate explanation has been offered and simply ignored leads me to believe his guilt more acutely &#8211; the past few days have seen lynches without reason triumph whereas a fairly decent case against Peter has largely failed. </p>

You won&#8217;t even name your Simpsons character because for some reason Clarence&#8217;s win condition is to know everyone&#8217;s character? Guys, if your alarm bells are not ringing they are broken.</p>
<p>Now the question is, to Lynch or not to Lynch? I agree with @Madeline that Paul is probably our last Mafioso. I think at this point I&#8217;d be willing to leave him alive.</p>
<p>Which leaves me with my other main theory, the Peter/Max conspiracy. I&#8217;m starting to think Peter as leader is unlikely. He role claimed (kind of) very quickly, and drew attention to himself early (even nearly getting himself Lynched). Max was almost Godkilled out of inactivity. But he wasn&#8217;t. Everyone since has been Godkilled, even the Godfather; why spare Max?</p>
<p>Metagaming aside, he convinced us to let him live by hinting that he had a role to claim. That role was Cop, and he threw Ernest at us to give us a Mafia kill (which he would have known from Frank). His excuses since at not investigating have often been forgetting, which seems possible, but I think that nearly being Godkilled would shake him into more action. He got away with claiming Carlos&#8217; Cult status with the Bus Driver (which up until recently I believe), and then he defended Peter when he came under fire. Honestly, I can&#8217;t see any reason why Peter wouldn&#8217;t have been converted by now, and his suspicious behaviour concretes this belief.</p>
<p>He claimed he couldn&#8217;t investigate Cynthia last night as she was incarcerated, but it could well be that he couldn&#8217;t convert her for the same reason. It&#8217;s a good alibi. The fact that he wasn&#8217;t active late yesterday yet still managed to get his night action in quickly also suggests that he was watching without participating. He hasn&#8217;t posted today; maybe he is doing the same? Waiting to the end to avoid suspicion?</p>
<p>What do other people think of this theory?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m uncomfortable having Beth around. I believe her role, but I think with Cult at an almost majority she is as dangerous as they are &#8211; it would not take much for her to instigate a mislynch and have the Cult simply bandwagon, likely ending the game.

"<p>Fine. I would have played it differently, but that&#8217;s not really relevant.<br />
In terms of finding the cult leader, almost every one has now role claimed. That&#8217;s useless for us to identify converts, as people have genuine roles they can claim and no one is going to counter claim. But at this stage, neither Peter, Paul or Victoria have role claimed (although Peter has basically claimed some sort of watcher role). My opinion is that we&#8217;re late enough in the game that hiding roles is no longer useful, the cult could feasibly win in a very short amount of time, so we need all the information available.<br />
It&#8217;s entirely possible that the cult leader has an alternative role they&#8217;re claiming, but once we know what&#8217;s being claimed we can start working out who&#8217;s most likely to be lying. I think we need to get the vote organised earlier this time, because there has been a ridiculous amount of bandwagoning. Although that is probably quite useful to us now, as we can look to see who is being protected, and by who. On which note, I remain convinced that Max has been converted, but working out the cult leader is more essential. However, if we vote for a townie now, the cult can easily bandwagon and lynch the wrong person, so we need to be sure &#8211; I think that means we should talk about it now and decide early, not just wait until 10 minutes before the vote closes.<br />

<p>@Peter: It&#8217;s certainly possible. However, Manuel&#8217;s story is backed up by Madeline&#8217;s claim. It&#8217;s conceivable that he wasn&#8217;t investigating when he found out he was incarcerated, but I&#8217;m more inclined to believe him at this point. You, on the other hand, are slightly more suspicious to me. The fact that you came up as Townie to Max suggests your innocence but could simply be his conversion. Hmm.</p>
<p>@Heidi: I think you misunderstand. If you get converted your win condition changes. You probably would even lose your Assassin shot, and it certainly would not be in your best interests to shoot at the leader.</p>
<p>The reason I advocated against a mass role claim is that it makes it easier for people to lie. For example, if no roles were claimed and someone tried to claim Dr Marvin Monroe, assuming that the character was obscure enough not to be included, I could call them out instantly. There are a few people I&#8217;m suspicious have already done this.</p>
<p>However, the only name now without a role (claimed or inferred) is Paul. Unsurprisingly this only compounds my suspicion. Of course this is based on the assumption everyone is telling the truth, which at this stage is almost certainly not true, but Paul&#8217;s claims of innocence are becoming less and less believable.</p>

While it&#8217;s definitely getting to crunch time, I don&#8217;t think encouraging mass role claims or throwing accusations around like confetti is our best option, and is quite rightly going to make you look suspicious.</p>
<p>@Max, I would assume that means Madeline incarcerated her last night. @Madeline, can you confirm?</p>
<p>Several people have pointed out how quickly last night ended and how that would imply the only people with night abilities are the ones who were active at the end: Beth, Madeline, Heidi, Jeff, Cynthia, Victoria and myself. I also came to this conclusion, but with a caveat: I looked quite carefully at who was in the other group. That would be Clarence, Manuel, Max, Paul and Peter.</p>
<p>Now I find it interesting that three of those are people who have claimed night abilities, ie Manuel and Max as Cops, Peter as Watcher. I think it&#8217;s quite likely that, if they were all originally truthful, at least one of them has been Cult converted by now (they would definitely be my first targets at Cult leader). However, I considered another possibility. Perhaps people were watching late yesterday without posting? That would explain the quick night ability use. Clarence and Max were both under fire at the end of yesterday, while Manuel and Peter seem not to have escaped suspicion entirely. This would suggest to me that sitting quiet while people yelled and screamed was a poor move.</p>
<p>But what about Paul? No one was really accusing him late yesterday. He could have watched, then acted as soon as Night fell perhaps predicting early daybreak. He was part of my original three accusees on Day 2, the other two of which have turned out neutral. He has consistently been in the background, and responds to accusations by acting outraged and defensive rather than reasonable. He has avoided bandwagoning ever since people suggested the act might be suspicious. To me, he fits the MO of a potential Cult leader perfectly.</p>
<p>I am definitely not going to vote yet. I would discourage anyone from voting too early before Sunset; if the Cult almost has majority, they could jump on any votes to cause an early mislynch and win.</p>

",True
"<p>I have been trying to subtly hint this for a while but it seems it has gone over the heads of most (that being said, unless I am mistaken, I think a few of you acknowledged?). </p>
<p>I am Mona &#8220;Grandma&#8221; Simpson &#8211; Bulletproof Townie. I started the game with Bulletproof x 1 &#8211; that is, I would be auto-protected the NEXT time I would otherwise die during the night. I was informed at the end of Night 2 however that my shield had evaporated (meaning I was targeted on the second night by some form of killing device).</p>
<p>However, I was then informed I had been granted a second shield at the end of Night 3 (that is, I was unprotected for Night 3 but protected onwards). I initially thought this was a result of my bulletproof status simply regenerating (e.g. I would be vulnerable the night after I lose my shield), but I have also mulled the possibility that it was as a reward for the lynching of Fred (Mr Burns), who is my meta-nemesis. In any case, this part is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>I lost my second shield on Night 7 &#8211; the night that nobody died. Essentially this meant several things to me:</p>
<p>1. That I had not been saved by Charles or Jeff on that particular night (can confirm?)<br />
2. That when I said &#8220;It is likely that the mafia targeted one of these four&#8221;, I was basically confirming that they had, and changing the protection plan to ensure continuity.<br />
3. That somebody wanted me dead.</p>
<p>Now my previous conclusions regarding cult leader pointed to an initially quiet but inexperienced player. This raised my suspicions of Clarence but not necessarily that he was cult leader. What I believed was that:</p>
<p>1. Since I had accused Clarence on Day 7<br />
2. That Clarence in a knee-jerk reaction attacked me on Night 7 (a poor move).</p>
<p>If that was true, then Clarence would be either:</p>
<p>1. A cult recruit with killing capability (possibly mafia)<br />
2. Lying about losing his vigilante power.</p>
<p>In either case I thought him an acceptable kill.</p>
<p>======================= HOWEVER =============================</p>
<p>I do not like admitting that I may have overlooked a psychological angle so this annoys me, but I think someone tried to and nearly succeeded in playing us &#8211; particularly myself.</p>
<p>The attack on me was quite possibly an attempt to *implicate* Clarence &#8211; I was the sole voter for Clarence the previous day and my death would be prima facie evidence of his guilt. In that way, not only do they get the night kill but they get the kill of Clarence the day after. </p>
<p>The troubling part of this equation is that it is unclear who we are against; mafia or cult (or both?). If the cult has obtained a killing power, through the mafia or otherwise then that would rule out those people who vigorously defended Clarence on Day 7 (unless they were heavily bussing). Alternatively, it is possible the play was simply a mafia action. In which case, the perpetrator is not highly sought after.</p>
<p>In any case, my shield did not regenerate this morning so I can assume that theory is rejected. I did not want to role-claim yesterday because if it did regenerate in the night, I would have been a prime target for recruitment. </p>
<p>= Priority =</p>
<p>This is really the tricky part; I believe there were cult on the bandwagon last night, but probably not a lot. Maybe only 2 or even 1. I think our priority now has got to be a mass-claim. We are 8 days in and any false-claim should be able to be picked apart through logical errors. </p>
<p>As such, I am going to suggest that everybody who has not already done so, claim their roles.</p>

"<p>@victoria. That does make some sense I guess in which case random mafia pleas keep targeting potential cultists. </p>
<p>Now I may be declared crazy for this but it is a thought that is makin me increasingly uncomfortable. What would the best thing for a cult leader to do but lead the charge against the cult and inform the towns opinions on what a cult leader looks like? What reason do we have to believe that the cult leader would lie low other than that Cynthia says they would? Wouldn&#8217;t the cult leader want to make a convincing role claim and point the investigation in the wrong direction? Additionally for me I find it suspicious that she continues to try to get me lynched (obviously this has no meaning for anyone else but I know I am a townie so it is to me). </p>
<p>Finally night roles: we need reports. As night ended early on the last two occasions anyone not providing two reports should be counted as very suspicious. </p>

<p>Mafia member if you are here: for gods sake stay alive and kill a cult member tonight (also, where were you last night?!)</p>
<p>As for the quick night metagame theory, one tactic could be to look at who was online at the end of yesterday as those people could have easily sent in a night action quickly. They were: Beth, Victoria, Jeff, Madeline, Charles, Cynthia, Heidi</p>
",True
"<p>Well, that was unsuccessful :S<br />
Also, if Cynthia is the role blocker, isnt that what Madeline was? (or are they slightly different)</p>
<p>I realise now why there had been votes for Max, at the time I didnt agree, because I thought we decided Max was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Just doing a bit of metagaming:<br />
The night ended rather quickly the past two nights, so Id say we<br />
A &#8211;  Dont have many night actions left, since thye have been recruited, and<br />
B &#8211; The people who are inactive dont currently have night abilities</p>
<p>The first person who comes to mind is Max. He has shown he is inactive and misses his night abilities. Though I dont think he is Leader, I do believe he is cult. (and therefore no longer has night abilities, and wont hold the nights up)<br />
Also, if last night, Heidi didnt use his ability, then we still have a mafia alive.<br />
If we dont kill a cult today, then they might possibly win before we get a chance to use our night abilities. So I think we should try and kill a cult (not take a risky shot at the possible leader), so we atleast get the following night to kill 2 people, and a good chance to get the leader.<br />

"<p>Wow that got intense after I left. Sorry I wasn&#8217;t around everyone, I had to be at a family dinner until after 9pm. To address some of the questions directed at me:</p>
<p>@Beth, I am not allowed to say how I know Rosie was on our side. As for the supposed inconsistency you point out I actually always speculated that I was given a vig kill for balance reasons, it was only after the mods revealed that the town aligned vigilante had been godkilled that I assumed Debbie had been that vigilante. That is my reasoning for why I was given the ability at that time. The reason provided to me by the mods said that the death of Rosie sparked the vigilante streak in me. So narratively it was when I saw the death of the (actually town aligned) Rosie that caused it but mechanically it was simply to rebalance the death of Debbie.</p>
<p>Of course I am just speculating, but I believe it best that I provide all the information that I have since I always seem to be close to being killed so that I don&#8217;t take any secrets to the grave like Rosie did.</p>

",True
"<p>Down to 12. Perhaps 6 of which are Cult. I don&#8217;t think I need to emphasise how careful we have to be today.</p>

<p>On the plus side, we did not Lynch a Townie. I realise that since we are quite possibly in a mislynch-and-lose situation now this is hardly consoling, but it shows we are on the right track at least: we are able to see when people are non-Townies. Or maybe I&#8217;m just being too hopeful.</p>
<p>More importantly, if someone killed Christy who was NOT Mafia I think now would be a good time to speak up. I assume we can all figure out what it means if no one owns up: the Mafia still exists in some form, and the Town is probably not even half the whole.

- @Jeff protects one of the two cops, as even if I don&#8217;t necessarily trust them they are important at this stage<br />
- @Victoria protects one of my targets from last night</p>
<p>@Beth, the reason I am protecting Madeline and Cynthia is because they are, in my mind, two of the more level headed and strategic players we have. I feel at this this stage of the game I want to protect someone I trust rather than a Cop, Mayor or Watcher whose allegiance I am still unsure of.</p>
<p>I know that trusting anyone at this stage is stupid, but my instincts on the Mafia have been good and I&#8217;d like to think similarly for the Town. If I were the Cult leader, I would be going for sure things. I wouldn&#8217;t attempt to convert someone who people have suggested can&#8217;t be converted. I wouldn&#8217;t attempt to convert someone who has a 50/50 chance of being protected, with this protection also believed to be anti-Cult. Someone asked me if I have confirmation that I am anti-Cult &#8211; I have not.

"<p>I just had another thought regarding night abilities.</p>
<p>Last night there were no deaths. This means that in all likelihood, one of our protectees was targeted by the mafia. Those four people were:</p>
<p>1. Charles or Jeff (protected by Jeff)<br />
2. Cynthia or Madeline (protected by Charles).</p>
<p>So let us assume that one of those people were targeted last night. For argument&#8217;s sake, we shall say Madeline. Given that the doctor&#8217;s can not protect the same person two nights in a row, Madeline would be an assured kill tonight. Charles could not protect her again.</p>
<p>As such, I suggest that CHARLES and JEFF, should SWAP their saving targets. That is:</p>
<p>1. Jeff saves Cynthia or Madeline (coin flip)<br />
2. Charles saves Charles or Jeff (coin flip).</p>
<p>In this way, the information gained from last night&#8217;s attack will be negated.</p>
<p>We should also discuss what should be done with other abilities. </p>
<p>I would suggest that role blockers and jailkeepers should target any of the quiet citizens (see Charles&#8217; list above) who remain alive at nightfall. Investigative roles (cops and watchers) should  check the recent role-claims to ensure logistics (E.G. Confirm Madeline as Jailkeeper and confirm Christy as roleblocker by investigating and/or watching to see their targets). We should probably confirm exact targets closer to nightfall.</p>

"<p>Okay um, so night falls in 4 and a half hours and we have not got a vote going. If we do not act quickly, then the cult will be able to choose their kill without resistance. I know we needed to hold off on voting, but this was in aide of discussion.</p>
<p>I am going to once again suggest Clarence for the lynch. There are two possibilities regarding Clarence:</p>
<p>1. If he is telling the truth: He was a one-hit vigilante who now holds no power. That being said, he is quite possibly a cultist, as the cult would have recruited him last night to hopefully gain a night kill. He also fits the MO of the cult leader&#8217;s recruits in that he has not been a huge target of discussion (see recruitment of Frank).</p>
<p>2. If he is lying, he is an excellent candidate for cult leader for the reasons discussed before this post.</p>
<p>I also think the response to this vote will be telling in the way that the cult reacts. I know this is not an ideal vote but it is one based on the balance of probabilities. Clarence decently fits the template for cult leader and was an obvious choice of recruitment last night.</p>
<p>**** MOST IMPORTANTLY: I offer this vote as I am highly alarmed that we are going into the final five hours of the day with only one candidate on a single vote (who would otherwise be voted for out of convenience). This is as much an exercise in information gathering as it is about playing the odds. </p>
<p>I will change my vote if it seems expedient but will largely be influenced by the votes of Charles and Madeline. In my opinion, those two and myself are the only townies I am inclined to believe are not cultists due to the immunity power of the Psychologist&#8217;s save. @Other citizens, while I highly encourage you to vote, I will be much more wary of bandwagons that do not include either of the aforementioned townies.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Start voting. The cult is holding off on voting so that they can minimise visibility of their voting trends. If we vote now, we get time to examine this and change our minds. I am voting Clarence as a statistically-decent alternative to Paul.</p>

"<p>@Madeline: Mass role-claim will still likely weaken us. Right now, the cult protection strategies and uncertainty means that the majority of cult recruits and indeed, the latter are concentrated in a specific group (e.g. those not covered by this strategy) or at least, that is the psychological assumption. By mass claiming, the number of strong roles for the cult to recruit increases and our ability to prevent their conversion decreases. </p>
<p>Essentially the argument is this: There are enough Simpsons characters and mafia roles for people to fakeclaim; of which I am near-certain has already occurred. In this sense, while it will give information, it&#8217;s value is not immediately apparent. Conversely, the value to the cult is enormous, in that it removes the uncertainties over who/when to recruit and what could stop them. We have to keep them hedging their bets.

Gine had a rather obvious turn of behaviour, so I think that cult recruits would most likely be the ones wiht the obvious behavior change, where as the Cult leader would be less likely to.

"<p>That is a fair point although I am not entirely convinced that Gine was necessarily bus-driven on Night 2 (may be other explanations we are unaware of or are being lied to). Nevertheless, I feel that if we accept that as a fact, the result is, on balance, largely the same:</p>

",True
"<p>OK right calm down. The last few days have messed up because of knee-jerk reactions. Let us consider the evidence we have and compare that to behaviour</p>
<p>CONFIRMED CULTISTS:<br />
- Gine<br />
- Frank</p>
<p>I think that the above speaks volumes about the leader. The fact that Frank was a member but not Carlos is interesting. More important is the recruitment of Gine. Gine was a poor choice because:</p>
<p>1. He had double chances of dying from protecting Carlos<br />
2. He had made himself a big target at night<br />
3. He was a popular target in the daily lynchings.</p>
<p>Essentially Gine was always on the cusp of dying. Points 1 and 2 were true as of the first day and so would have been known to the leader before their first recruitment. Recruiting a cult member who was all but assured of death is extremely poor play especially early on, as it not only reduces cult numbers but risks exposure of the cult.</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>Psychologically, it points towards the following: </p>
<p>1. The cult leader is likely a new, poor or inexperienced player &#8211; They saw Gine&#8217;s strength in arguments but failed to consider the inevitability of his demise. Recruiting both Gine and Frank also indicates this as it is a haphzard strategy.</p>
<p>2. Likely not forceful in opinions &#8211; One recruits in order to make up for one&#8217;s own lackings. Gine&#8217;s recruitment was likely a way of gaining argumentative muscle.</p>
<p>Following on from that:</p>
<p>3. The cult leader has probably radically changed behaviour &#8211; It is unlikely that they maintained the same behaviour. They would change behaviour fairly constantly as they have massive self-doubt over the way they play. This is reinforced by both recruiting Gine and Frank (two different strategies) and recruiting Gine (self-doubting own opinion).</p>
<p>As such, I think we are looking for someone who:</p>
<p>1. Started off relatively quiet PARTICULARLY those who voted with Gine early on based on his forcefulness (Being influenced if not enamored with him).</p>
<p>2. Imploded around the time of Frank&#8217;s death and began talking lots more (Likely not accusations but definitely more participation).</p>
<p>3. Has gone to lengths to avoid suspicion, whether by withholding accusations, weak role-claims or feigned outrage when being mulled as a candidate.</p>
<p>4. Buddies heavily &#8211; Self doubt means that they are forced to try and get on-side with others rather than risk personal guilt being exposed.</p>
<p>5. So then who to lynch?</p>
<p>My vote would be against someone who fits those criteria, particularly the first. </p>
<p>This is a very important point &#8211; Since the cult leader is likely easily influenced, I would assume they have been influenced by the saving deterrence strategy. In the same way that the doctors have healed high profile targets at night to deter the mafia from even trying to kill them, I believe the cult leader would have followed this lead and rather than try and recruit big targets, they would be content in revealing lesser roles to ensure their survival. This is why Carlos was not recruited. Gine was only recruited for his force. What this means is that even if we don&#8217;t hit the leader, we likely still sink a battleship.</p>
<p>In this sense, there are good targets but we have to choose carefully AND we have to go slowly. The cult is probably around 4-5 at the moment and will form a significant voting bloc. To ensure a bad lynch does not take place, the lynch should be considered heavily. In this way, I will not vote until tomorrow until more discussion has taken place around these points. I encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>Since someone killed Shelly the night before last, there must still be atleast 1 mafia alive (assuming no vigilante kills).</p>

"<p>Assuming one original Cult member and one conversion per night, that makes seven Cult members, minus two who have died. So five. If we are assuming no more night kills (I think a poor assumption) then after two days they will have 7 of 12 players. If we assume the Mafia still has at least one person, then in one day they will have 6 of 12. Eep.</p>
<p>If we assume Max is Sane then Peter is not a suspect anymore. Manuel also seems to be off the hook. At this stage I think the most reasonable theory is that the Cult leader has been one of the quiet, forgettable members and has survived by blending in. There&#8217;s a few possibilities for who this might be, but if you cross-check any likely list of with the accusations I made on Day 2, I am quite interested in @Chris and @Paul.</p>
<p>Remember that we Lynched Arthur that day for similar reasons to why I was suspicious of those two, and he turned out to be Neutral. I then stopped considering them likely Scum as, in my mind, they had not responded to my accusations the way a Mafioso would. But a Cult leader? Interesting. @Paul, please do not get offended by these accusations. As I am a fan of information, I invite you to tell us what you know or believe.

"<p>Well ok, time for some more maths. Apparently the mafia godfather was godkilled, and the jailer is town-aligned. Given the number of successful mafia kills, its actually possible we&#8217;ve got rid of them all and we just need to get rid of the cult to win. So there&#8217;s potentially 9 or so townies, which would give us a pretty good lead. But then we don&#8217;t know exactly how many people have already been successfully converted, and there may be heaps more mafia left, which is a less good scenario.<br />
In terms of actually finding the cult, I was going to investigate last night, but got incarcerated&#8230; I guess that still gives us information, because it means Madeleine hasn&#8217;t lost her power as a jailer and therefore isn&#8217;t cult (provided she&#8217;s telling the truth, but there hasn&#8217;t been a counterclaim), so that&#8217;s one person off the list. Apart from that, there are people I suspect might have been converted, but that&#8217;s based on me judging on very little and not nearly enough to decide on. And that also would mean they aren&#8217;t the cult leader, and therefore only of secondary importance at this stage. So I&#8217;m looking for suggestions &#8211; I think the cult leader must be someone who has been relatively quiet and not overly suspicious since the beginning. Probably not someone who has roleclaimed either, but people lie so I&#8217;m not ruling anyone out because of that. So basically most of the people who are left. Awesome..<br />

<p>I did this for two reasons. Firstly I was fairly sure you were telling the truth, but I wanted final confirmation by seeing what you would report back after being incarcerated. And since I was fairly sure you were telling the truth, I wanted to save you from both death and a conversion. I cost us an investigation, but I was willing to trade it for your safety and the final confirmation (in my mind) of your truth fulness</p>
<p> I attempted to do this on night 4 as well, but then @peter was the one who claimed to have been incarcerated. I couldn&#8217;t understand it, I thought you guys might have been colluding together as cult or mafia. And I did honestly believe you would&#8217;ve have been told you were incarcerated which is also why I thought Peter must&#8217;ve been lying. I was told by the mods after sunset that he would&#8217;ve been told this. After the reveal of the bus driver I could only conclude you were both telling the truth, thus my post yesterday saying I believed you both. As of now I believe you. Peter is still slightly suspicious after yesterdays contradiction of your story, but he definitly has a visiting role to be told he was incarcerated and you very easily could&#8217;ve been bus driven two nights in a row, if he acted before being killed. </p>

<p>While I hate @Chris&#8217; suggestion that we give up on finding the Cult leader this round, even my suspicions of Max are tenuous and he&#8217;s the best I could come up with. And after typing up that  long post, I&#8217;m doubting myself and am suspicious of Peter again. </p>

If he has retained his double vote that makes the cult more powerful, and we actually do ourselves a favour by removing him. It&#8217;s risky, because if he is still town we lose a lot of power in the end game, but, we are doing very well against the mafia so far, to the point where I think it&#8217;s worth the risk.</p>

"<p>Now @Max is weird.</p>
<p>He may be telling the truth. He was at risk of being God Killed and we got the opportunity to save him. No one else has been given this chance. I think it was @Beth who suggested that this might be a ploy by the Mods to save the cult leader and any recruited cult members that would also die if he died. But they could also have wanted to save our sane cop. </p>
<p>His lack of investigations could be exactly as he said, he forgot. Consistent with the fact that he was at risk of being God killed in the first place. But just as easily he could&#8217;ve decided against releasing any more information for fear of exposing himself.</p>
<p>I actually believed he would reveal his character name to be Rex Banner, given his claim to find out springfield names as well as alignment. Being a super cop this would make sense. I would like to point out that he has never demonstrated this claimed ability though. </p>
<p>Now his claim of Lisa as his character name doesn&#8217;t contradict his claims, Lisa has often shown an investigative streak. But it&#8217;s odd. </p>
<p>Now, in my mind there are three possibilites:</p>
<p>Max is telling the truth. Therefore he is just the worst Detective ever and has Carlos said should almost be lynched on principle.</p>
<p>Max is lying and is mafia. Using Ernest to gain trust. Unlikely given rosie&#8217;s plan to do the same, but possible. Hasn&#8217;t released any investigations because he is lazy, or given up because the mafia have just been destroyed in this game.</p>
<p>Max is the Cult leader. He found out who the mafia were through Frank. Who was recruited night 1 or 2. I wonder why he implicated Carlos was cult, as it would draw attention to himself, but he could&#8217;ve recruited him with the intention of implicating him, to get a second lynch opportunity to prove sanity and to gain two cult votes if Carlos wasn&#8217;t lynched (and if recruits retain powers)</p>

I really don&#8217;t want people saying I&#8217;m cult because I&#8217;m quiet but I&#8217;m just totally baffled by this cult leader thing because, while I know how desperately we need votes for a good lynch I feel like I have no idea how to do this. With mafia you sort of end up feeling them out, which is just shown with how well we were doing with that but with cult, the only people I&#8217;m suspicious I also sort of believe :/ Sigh.

"<p>Some maths:</p>
<p>There are 15 players left alive.</p>
<p>The maximum number of cult players is 4 (1 cult leader + nightly recruits for 5 nights &#8211; 2 deaths) so a random attack has a 25% chance of killing Cult (of course I know I am not cult so in my case it is a 28% chance (4/14), as it is for any other non-cult member)</p>
<p>If left unchecked (and nobody else dies by mistake) the cult wins in 4 nights. For every non cult member we kill this count will go down by one. However given the current level of death we are probably much closer to a cult victory unless we manage to kill some members or the cult leader.</p>
<p>I suggest a new priority list:</p>
<p>1. Cult Leader<br />
2. Suspected Cultists who&#8217;s confirmation as cult would provide solid information about other people&#8217;s cult status<br />

",True
"<p>So,</p>
<p>Both @Peter and @Manuel can be telling the truth. If I make an assumption about Peter&#8217;s powers, which I&#8217;ll get to. </p>
<p>So: Night 2:</p>
<p>Peter claims to have seen Gine visit Manuel. An impossible situation, Gine&#8217;s role doesn&#8217;t visit.</p>
<p>Manuel then claims to be a cop who investigated Gine. Result Townie -&gt; Mafia given insaneness, which if believed to be a cop has been confirmed with 3.5 results (considering shelly as a half as it was claimed after her death). </p>
<p>At this stage I&#8217;m willing to believe Manuel is a cop, given no counterclaim of Simpson&#8217;s character Chief Wiggum, and also given the lack of claims of Lou and Eddie. Since Rosie wasn&#8217;t a cop and @Max is claiming Lisa Simpson (I&#8217;ll talk about Max later), there may be only one actual cop and I believe that would be Wiggum if it was the case. </p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s assume Gine was bus driven on night 2. This would explain both his apparent ability to visit and his alignment. I don&#8217;t know why the mafia decided to bus drive one of their own with Gine, maybe to get white mage protection on one of their players, since Jeff was likely to protect him night 2? But this theory means that Manuel was visited by a mafia player night 2 and didn&#8217;t die. That&#8217;s a whole new bunch of things to consider.</p>
<p>Now, if this is true it explains why Peter didn&#8217;t see Fred again because he would&#8217;ve targeted the bus driven player in order to silence Gine day 3. But it doesn&#8217;t explain why Peter didn&#8217;t see Jeff who claims to have protected Gine night 2. Assumption to fix this problem: Peter can either track or watch, but not both, and he doesn&#8217;t know which it will be. Would explain the apparent confusion regarding his reports from the mods. </p>
<p>Now Last night:</p>
<p>Manuel claims to have investigated Shelly, and Peter claims to have followed Manuel, who went nowhere and wasn&#8217;t visited. Again Peter&#8217;s results can be explained by having his target, in this case Manuel, bus driven. Bus driving usually only affects the receiving end of abilities so Manuel still would&#8217;ve been able to investigate. </p>
<p>My Thoughts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m concluding for the logic above and a few assumptions of my own that Peter and Manuel are not mafia. That is, they aren&#8217;t faking their claims and using knowledge as mafia members that they are telling the truth or they are using knowledge gained as Cult leader. That clears Manuel in my mind, because there is no reason to get Gine and Russel wrong the way he did. If your faking with correct information you would get it right. I also think Peter is unlikely as his claims are difficult to fake. and I keep getting stuck in circular logic that means the claims he is making are one step away from getting him lynched (ie. if we lynch manuel on his findings last night and he&#8217;s innocent we should then have peter lynched, or vig. killed since I assume we have a viglilante, therefore it&#8217;s a bad idea to point the finger at him as cult leader)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going with the assumption that the mafia have not made a succesful kill since night 1, if that was even them and not Melinder. I don&#8217;t think they kill Frank, and since the bus driver was mafia aligned, they don&#8217;t do it accidently either. So Frank in my mind was a vigilante kill. As I pointed out and Clarence has since expanded on Gine was bashed to death. I believe he was also Vigilante killed. So the mafia have targeted protected players each night. </p>
<p>Anyway, for now, I&#8217;m thinking Peter and Manuel are both telling the truth.</p>
",True
"<p>I had a thought in regards to Manuel.<br />
He claims to have targeted Shelly last night<br />
Peter claims that he didnt target anyone last night.<br />
Assuming that one of them is lying (Ill be pissed off if they both are), theres two options.<br />
1. Peter is lying and manuel is a cop.<br />
2. Manuel is lying and and Peter is telling the truth. If this is the case, Manuel does not have a night ability, and Isnt the Leader.</p>
<p>So he is either a cop, or not the leader, so if we are going for the leader, killing him isnt the right choice. </p>
<p>NOTE: after typing that, I realised that there is a chance they are both lying, either an involved mafia or cult plan, to help us gain the trust of one of the other, or one is mafia, and the other is cult, so they are trying to work against eachother, without realising. So we must still be wary(but nothing in this game is certain.</p>

"<p>@Heidi, I find your comment confusing as, like you say, this is a game and people really shouldn&#8217;t take accusations personally. Unless people start actively insulting or threatening others I don&#8217;t think we need lessons in etiquette while accusing.</p>
<p>As much as I really don&#8217;t like to say it, I agree with @Chris that we&#8217;re unlikely to get the leader this round. I say this because my own opinions have changed several times today and to be honest I haven&#8217;t got a clue what direction to cast my vote if we&#8217;re after the leader. However, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m 100% convinced on the Manuel thing. Now that we know there&#8217;s a Bus Driver, there&#8217;s quite a reasonable chance that Gine was Bus Driven when Manuel investigated him and that Manuel is Insane. Less likely but still possible was that Russell and Ernest were both Bus Driven on their respective nights and that Manuel is Sane (and of course Gine was converted later). There is the possibility that he is lying, as well. But I&#8217;m inclined to believe him for now, we don&#8217;t want to lose our cops unless necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, @Cynthia makes a reasonable argument against Manuel. However it hinges on who you find more believable; him or Peter. I think Peter&#8217;s results have been questionable at best &#8211; I think it&#8217;s entirely possible that Frank told him Fred was the Silencer and so Peter outed him to get in our good graces. Once again, this is based on several large assumptions.</p>
<p>If we want to go down @Chris&#8217; path, I think I would prefer to Lynch Carlos over Manuel. For one, if I was Cult I would definitely have recruited him. If we believe Max&#8217;s Sanity and allegiance, which I do for now, then he is Cult; a lot of people questioned this based on the fact that we assume Cult conversion happens after investigation and that Peter is telling the truth, but we simply don&#8217;t know either of these to be true. The other reason is, playing strategically, the Mayor&#8217;s powers aren&#8217;t overwhelming whereas a Cop, Sane or Insane, is useful to us.</p>

"<p>@Clarence: I think everyone has hinted towards their role at least somewhat. I would assume this game is role madness where everybody has some form of an ability (whether active, passive or latent). Role-claiming is good to a certain extent as it allows for narrowing strategies (see night protection strategies) but it is weak when overly done as it increases information for the already informed minorities. So while it can be beneficial for say, some doctors to claim, it would be bad if all of them did if that makes sense. It isn&#8217;t a precise science but based on individual circumstances.</p>
<p>That being said, of course it is smart to amalgamate the already given role-claims as it may give an indication on who is lying.

I don&#8217;t think that role-claims are going to be where today&#8217;s lynch should come from necessarily though. It is more than a false-claim.

<p>As to the veracity of your claims, I am undecided but am (at this stage) leaning towards your innocence. I am largely basing this on the claim of Simpsons fora (Bart) and of a seemingly strange role (awakened vigilante). I think there is a possibility that you are not revealing the whole story on the latter of these counts but we shall discuss this as the day develops. I do not rule out the possibility that you are lying and are as such, having a good game.</p>
<p>For the moment, I am strongly suspicious of Manuel. Peter&#8217;s evidence is damning, and I am disinclined to believe that Peter is lying. </p>
<p>I doubt Manuel is cult leader (perhaps but unlikely), but strongly suspect he is a cult member and/or mafioso &#8211; a cop would be a logical recruit if we dismiss the roles that are given supposed immunity (e.g. Charles and his saves). The investigations of dead bodies seems troublesome to me (same strategy employed by Rosie when lying) and seems to complement his insanity story too easily. What was the virtue of investigating Shelley anyway? It wouldn&#8217;t have specifically shown Jester. </p>
<p>We were quick to dismiss Manuel because his cop accusation against Russell would have seemed too much of a gambit &#8211; e.g. I claim he is mafia, but when he is not, they just kill me. However, it is not unthinkable that he could have known that with enough sincerity, he could convince people the next lynch that he was not the prime suspect. That rather, he is insane &#8211; a story he solidified today.</p>

<p>What must be considered highly is night abilities options.</p>
<p>*** A new vigilante is a great weapon against the cult. If we can ensure a cult member dies at night (does not necessarily have to be leader), we can at least halt their expansion while we hunt for the kingpin. The downside is that it may mean killing some high-profile townies. In that sense, we should consider who should be *killed* at night for this aim. </p>
<p>At this stage, the only cult immunity abilities that have been implied are (unconfirmed):</p>
<p>Charles and his heals<br />
Madeline&#8217;s ability </p>
<p>I would encourage @Madeline not to reveal the details of your ability but simply to use it on high-profile targets that are NOT being protected by Charles. Even if neither of your abilities protect against culting, the mere fact that they MIGHT should deter the cult leader from trying anything. WIth that the case, both the cult and mafia prize pools are significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Now this post contains a bit more than my usual conjecture so I would really really really like to hear some feedback. I will make myself a bit more available this afternoon. Let me just stress this though; we really need to get organised for today&#8217;s lynch &#8211; hypothesis is great, but we need to choose a lynchee that is the best rational choice.</p>

"<p>Firstly a thought on Smithers:</p>
<p>In response to analysis of Simpsons characters in question and how Smithers doesn&#8217;t seem likely mafia I think this is an important point. Smithers would be in a perfect position to give information to the town about mafia activities given he was working for and was trusted by Mr Burns. He could easily be present in their meetings and provide us with information, besides he always seemed a sneaky rat-like character to me.</p>
<p>Last nights kills:</p>
<p>I have had a thought regarding the events of last night, firstly we need to assume:</p>
<p>1) That the mafia failed to kill anyone.</p>
<p>I know that Ernest was vigilante killed by me (hence found beaten), Shelley also seems to have been vigilante killed (&#8220;a mangled collection of flesh. No one could withstand such a beating&#8221;) while Patty blew herself up. The other kills are Homer and Marge (stab and gunshot wounds and &#8220;other assorted&#8221;), Wayne (gunshot wounds), Melinder and Bobby (in a night filled with gunshots and screams), Gine (beaten) This to me suggests that mafia kills are shown as gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>Even without these descriptions, the simplest explanation for last night involves one bomb death and two vigilante kills (shelley could plausibly have been a mafia target but then why describe her as being killed in the same way as the vigilante killed Ernest?)</p>
<p>2) That upon being converted into the cult you lose any special abilities (I haven&#8217;t seen this god confirmed but other players who have played with a cult before may know this for certain)</p>
<p>If we assume that these things are true there are 3 possible actions the mafia could have taken last night:</p>
<p>1. Not targeted anyone &#8211; very unlikely, it is in their interest to kill any non mafia to ensure they can maintain a majority</p>
<p>2. Targeted someone they thought was a townie &#8211; possible, but as has been pointed out the cult is more of a threat to them as it can grow in size.</p>
<p>If they targeted a townie then they were prevented because the night crew is protecting the right people so good job!</p>
<p>3. Targeted someone they thought was cult (especially cult leader) &#8211; assuming the majority of mafia are non-cult they should be aiming to kill the cult leader (this can sometimes kill all cult members which could be useful for the mafia) but it would also eliminate the threat of a cult majority.</p>
<p>If they targeted someone they thought was cult leader and were prevented from killing them due to a protective role intervening then it MUST be the case that a townie is protecting a cult member/leader (this is assuming that role powers are lost once in cult). I&#8217;m assuming they are doing this unwittingly as they believe they are protecting a fellow townie.</p>
<p>Thus I ask any protective roles to reveal who they protected last night (assuming this won&#8217;t jeopardise future protection plans, if it will keep the info to yourself and consider my conclusions) These people could be cult members/the leader that the mafia were targeting to kill.</p>
<p>Of course the mafia could be just as bad as the town seems to be at spotting the cult leader however if there is someone who was protected AND is suspicious for other reasons I would be more concerned of their cult status.</p>

<p>Regarding my previous post:</p>
<p>A Bus Driving would make sense, actually. I was investigated Night 3, Gine died during Night 4. So the Mafia, if they&#8217;d bus driven me with Gine, discovered that Gine was a Cultist from Max&#8217;s investigation of me (which would have rerouted to Gine and they would know that) and that&#8217;s why they killed him the next night.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming there that I was swapped with Gine since he was the one killed the next night and the Mafia have a vested interest in killing Cult.</p>

"<p>@Madeline &#8211; Well, yes, unless he is lying or bus driven. It honestly comes down to who you trust more, or how unlucky you think I am to have been targeted by Otto. </p>
<p>I mean, given the number of people who were likely to investigate/watch/whatever me, I&#8217;m the logical choice for an anti-town bus drive, but how likely is it that I was Bus Driven with a cultist on the first night? Not that likely, and then the Mafia would know who the Cult Leader (or first cultist) was, and then they would know the identity of a cultist. But then the Mafia would know who a cultist was (as they knew who they switched me with), which would explain their uncanny shot with the night kills the next night. Which would mean Gene was culted Night 1. Which might also explain Peter&#8217;s turnaround, if he was night-recruited between the nights that he switched up his view on the Manuel/Gene thing.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s how it went, that means Night 1 was Gene, Night 2 was Frank (he was killed Night 3) Night 3 was Peter, and we can&#8217;t really know Night 4 or 5.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t gel with what Manuel got as results in his investigatin&#8217;. He would have found Gene to be Cult, as he investigated Gene second night.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m thinking either Manuel is lying or the Mafia got lucky with the killing of Gene and I was not Bus Driven, which would mean Max was lying.</p>
<p>That was pretty stream-of-consciousness, so I hope y&#8217;all got that.</p>
<p>So, from my point of view we have Max/Manuel, or Manuel/Peter as pairs of one-or-the-other-is lying. But I don&#8217;t think any of them is Leader.</p>

"<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Interesting night, 3 deaths and a confirmed Mafia sided Bus Driver. And no more Jester threat. Very good night, indeed. </p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t post earlier today but was reading and noticed the contradiction between @Manuel and @Peter. While I want to hear more from either of them, I doubt either of them will change their story. I have some thoughts about them, but I need to think it through some more before I say them.</p>
<p>I think @Clarence&#8217;s explanation re: Cynthia&#8217;s accusations is ok, and if he&#8217;s telling the truth about his character name, I can believe that he would be given a one off vig. kill. Bart&#8217;s good with a bad guy streak.</p>

These can be explained away by not believing that he is scum and everyone else being as lost as I am towards finding the Cult leader.

Id imagine he is what he caims to be. He got a night kill because of someones death, which would imply he was a regular townie, who gains an ability after someones death (in this case Rosie) He may not be told about this ability, similarly to the insane Cop.</p>
<p>Since Rosie was also a Regular mafia (and it seems everyone in this game has a special ability/role) then Id say Rosie may have had a similar thing to Bart. Smithers doesnt seem like someone who would be mafia, but I dont know the relation between Bart and Smithers, seems abit odd.</p>

"<p>Sorry, sometimes with communication things make sense in my head and then I leave stuff out when explaining it.</p>
<p>When Frank died, we knew that there was a Mafia member in the Cult. Presumably Frank would have told the entire Cult who was in the Mafia, which meant that the Cult members knew who the Mafia were. Prior to the information about the Cult infiltrating the Mafia being revealed to the Town, it would have been good strategy for the Cult leader, to vote for members of the Mafia (and maybe even lead lynches on them). That is why I suspect people who voted and led the lynch on Fred (since he was a Mafia member and it&#8217;s likely Frank was Culted before then).</p>
<p>After, however, the Cult Leader would have known that we knew the above, so may have lain low or changed his strategy in order to make it look like he didn&#8217;t have an uncanny knowledge of who the Mafia were without a backup claim. Or maybe the Cult Leader didn&#8217;t change his behaviour in order to not look suspicious. We can&#8217;t know for sure.

"<p>Looking back yesterday at my list of &#8220;suspects&#8221;, I realised that 4 of 5 of them are now dead. Of those 4, one&#8217;s role was not revealed, one was Jester and the other two were Mafia. Before I let this inflate my ego beyond recognition, I&#8217;ll admit two things; one, while I seem to be reasonably good at picking the Mafia, I&#8217;ve been dismal at picking Cult; two, it&#8217;s probably worth discussing @Manuel, the last remaining one on the list.</p>
<p>I think at this point I believe Manuel. The theory then confirmation that there is a Bus Driver in the game lends credibility to his inexplicable inconsistencies. Hence, I think as he does that he was Bus Driven on whatever night he targeted Gine, and that he is Insane. How the Mafia knew to target him I have no idea, but well played.</p>
<p>On the Cult/Mafia detection thing, I think perhaps this is an indication that the Cult are playing a cleverer game than the Mafia. Or at the very least, having not played that many games with Cult in them before, I am not the best at picking them. For that reason, I&#8217;m inclined to go along with Carlos&#8217; theory on the Lynching of Fred. However I think we should remember that in that case, most people were going off the say so of Peter and the fact that Fred&#8217;s death would give us information regardless. Once Fred started responding people were even more convinced he was Scum. So I would propose we also look at people who were suggesting a Lynch of Ernest and Rosie; matching these lists up might give us a good suspect.</p>
<p>For the sake of objectivity I will acknowledge the other possibility: that I am Cult trying to get in the Town&#8217;s good books a la Carlos&#8217; theory. I haven&#8217;t received confirmation from the Gods that I am uncultable, nor do I expect to, but at the very least the possibility should act as a deterrant to the Cult. Putting myself in the leader&#8217;s shoes, I would want my conversion to be a sure thing. This is consistent with the fact that Frank was converted, who I think was not particularly high on anyone&#8217;s radar.</p>
<p>I think if @Peter is Scum he could also be a clever Mafioso. Pitting himself against Fred would certainly condemn one to death but would potentially alleviate suspicions of the other. In any case, I wouldn&#8217;t recommend a Lynch of Peter. In my mind he is Townie, Mafia or Cult Recruit, not leader.</p>

"<p>So I was trying to put myself in the mindset of the Cult Leader. I realised that the Cult had recruited at least one Mafia member (Frank) before anybody even knew they existed. I don&#8217;t think the Cult Leader would lay low the entire game. I think, instead, they would try and use their knowledge of the Mafia to try and get into the Town&#8217;s good graces. Now, we&#8217;ve got a 2/3 chance that Frank was recruited Night 1 or Night 2 instead of Night 3, and so had the chance to talk to everyone. So that&#8217;s a solid chance the Cult knew.</p>
<p>Surprise surprise, the day before Frank died in the night, we lynched a Mafia member, Fred. I think that that&#8217;d be a highly unlikely coincidence if it weren&#8217;t instigated or at least helped by the Cult.</p>
<p>Looking back, I see that Peter was the one who instigated the lynching of Fred, in that he supplied the Watcher info. Of course, my theories about Peter involve him being turned Cult Night 3, so I&#8217;m not sure about that. There are alternatives that explain his turnaround on the Gine/Manuel visitation (for example, he guessed/knew that Manuel was a Cop, and didn&#8217;t want to get Gine lynched). Anyway. The people who voted Fred and are still living are:</p>
<p>Charles, Cynthia, Christy, Madeline, Beth, Heidi, Victoria and Max.</p>
<p>We can try to whittle this down further. Charles, for instance, has claimed anti-cult doctor. Madeline similarly. Heidi voted Russell, which I think a Cult leader would have been reticent to do (on the other hand, her joking about the cult leader outing themselves smacks of trying too hard to fit in, so I&#8217;m unsure on this one).</p>
<p>Voting patterns from Day 4 forward are less likely to be useful as the Cult Leader would have known we knew they were Cult, so may have attempted to lie low since we knew Mafia were in the Cult. Voting patterns from Day 1 are fairly useless since there were no recruitments yet so it&#8217;s unlikely the Cult were privy to any secret knowledge.</p>

The Mafia has clearly figured this out, due to their murder of the obvious non-Townie Shelly. This is good news. It essentially means most of us are momentarily on the same side, until we can stop the Cult.</p>
<p>Luckily, with less people comes less suspects. We know Carlos is not Cult leader, even if he is still a recruit possibility. I think at this point most people accept I am not a likely suspect (justification yesterday and earlier but at this point I don&#8217;t think it bears repeating). Based on unchallenged role claims and general believability, I think we can also safely rule out Madeline, Jeff, Cynthia, Beth, Max, Heidi and Victoria.</p>
<p>As myself and @Madeline mentioned, @Peter has been inconsistent with his stories and the claim that he is been unable to Watch for two consecutive nights is unconvincing. Regardless, I would like to hear from him and any other investigative roles about what they found last night. So that would be @Max and @Manuel.</p>
<p>So for those of you following at home, that leaves Chris, Christy, Clarence and Paul unmentioned. Depending on what Peter has to say I could be swayed to pursue that path, but otherwise these are the suspects that we should be talking to, then depending on answers, Lynching and encouraging Mafia kills of.</p>

"<p>All I have to explain my behaviour and uncertainty to the group is that I have never played online mafia before and as such am very afraid of making a mislynch. Additionally I have never played with this many or such varied roles before which is why I have asked so many questions as to how roles interact or what they can do.</p>
<p>My official role is that of a regular Townie (and I have not even been approached by anyone) which is why I have not participated in the provision of information. I have been unable to offer long or detailed analysis of events because my outside game activities are extremely time consuming. I acknowledge that this is not much of an excuse but it is all I have to offer.</p>
<p>The only additional information that I have to offer is that after the events of yesterday I was given the opportunity to make one vigilante kill which I directed at Ernest killing the mafia bus driver. The reason I chose this target, apart from our existing suspicion of him is that I have reason to believe Rosie was not all that she seemed and was in fact a very good source of mafia information and so selected someone she had targeted for lynching.</p>

"<p>Clarence overview:</p>
<p>VOTING RECORD:</p>
<p>Day 1: No vote<br />
Day 2: Voted for Shelley when it was a big bandwagon. Changed to even bigger bandwagon.<br />
Day 3: No vote<br />
Day 4: No vote<br />
Day 5: No vote</p>
<p>DISCUSSION RECORD: </p>
<p>Day 1: Sat on fence multiple times. Expressed uncertainty over who to vote for and asked for options to be reexplained. No real defense to accusations.<br />
Day 2: Followed two bandwagons by acknowledging that he was following a bandwagon. Sat on fence by saying he wasn&#8217;t sure about me or Gene.<br />
Day 3: Sat on fence by saying no evidence against Gene. Sat on fence by saying bandwagon was too eager on Fred.<br />
Day 4: Offered a lack of understanding of cult. Sat on fence by offering both sides of discussion regarding Max<br />
Day 5: Sat on fence in regards to vote. One post directed at Rosie (possible bussing).</p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>1. Clarence has voted on ONE out of FIVE days.<br />
2. He has not made a single accusation but rather chooses to defend people who have been accused or voting with already significant bandwagons. The people he has already defended are:</p>
<p>a) Gene<br />
b) Cynthia<br />
c) Fred<br />
d) Max<br />
e) Rosie</p>
<p>Now I put myself in fairly horrible company there, but I say this by way of explanation: Clarence is not trying to defend his people; he is trying to stay alive. He was scared over his reticence on the first day and leapt into bandwagons on the second. Noting that looked even worse he returned to the quiet and thoughtful questioner. </p>
<p>I feel that he is either mafia or cult leader (likely not cult). I would not be at all surprised if the latter, as he does fit the description fairly perfectly. He remains hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p>Now remember, we have to keep chasing cult leader. Cultists just aren&#8217;t good enough. Every cult lynch actually increases their chances of winning (they maintain their total with a night recruit by increase their percentage). That&#8217;s why I say priority list is:</p>
<p>1. Cult leader<br />
2. Mafia<br />
3. Cultists</p>
<p>Going on the basis of this, I am going to start the ball rolling early with a new accusation (which worked out well when I did it to Rosie haha). My person of interest is Clarence. I feel he is the definition of staying under the radar and fits the Cult Leader MO perfectly in my opinion. I am also unconvinced of Victoria but recognise that she may have a role.</p>

This means he is guaranteed protection every night (he is protected if he protects a Doctor), and I have a 75% chance of surviving attacks each night (either he protects me, or I have a 50% chance of being protected from the previous night). This will keep both remaining protective roles alive, which I think at this stage is vital.</p>
<p>I on the other hand will continue to protect based on the game theoretic method we have been using. At this stage, as none of the claimed investigative roles are confirmed as Sane or non-Scum, and Carlos is a Cult suspect in some peoples books (plus admittedly his additional power isnt really that great), I will be sticking with my instincts and targeting either Madeline or Cynthia.</p>
<p>Detectives, scout out for a Cult leader. Any of our potential Cultists could be investigated, or any of the quiet ones who have uncertain allegiances. @Peter, if you are with us, Watch strategically but I would suggest not forewarning us, as it will just mean the Scum will target someone else.</p>

"<p>Essentially, the bus driver role means that two people are swapped in the night, so that any abilities that target A in the night instead target B, and vice versa. The reason I know that is that I was informed by Madeline in-thread on one of the earlier days (though she is apparently not the bus driver). Thus, if one of your targets was bus-driven, it would have to be Russell (as I was Bus Driven Night 2, and if it was with Gine it would not have changed the investigation since I am Townie). So Russell, being Town, must have been switched with a Mafia, ergo you are Sane. </p>
<p>Which means that Rosie is a Townie, so is not lying about her results. Since we have established you are Sane, since you got Ernest as Town and she got Ernest as Mafia, she is Insane.</p>
<p>Which is impossible, since she correctly identified Gine as Cult and therefore must be Sane.</p>
<p>In addition, her identifying Max as Townie, would mean that Max isn&#8217;t lying either. Which is again impossible, since, as I have already established, one of them is lying.</p>
<p>THEREFORE! Rosie is certainly lying. You are either also lying, or she is the Godfather, who appears innocent to investigation.</p>

"<p>@Charles &#8211; I don&#8217;t think that two Sane cops is really that strange &#8211; we started with 30 players, and every Mafia we&#8217;ve lynched so far has had an additional power. Add in cult, and we can expect the Townie side to be pretty powerful too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now a little bit uneasy about lynching Rosie, given how many people have quickly jumped on the bandwagon. On the other hand, though:</p>
<p>From my point of view, I can be certain that either Rosie or Max is lying. Max has me as Cult, so is either lying or has a cyclical insanity thing happening. If he was telling the truth, then that means Ernest is not Mafia, which means that Rosie is Insane or lying. But she can&#8217;t be insane, since she correctly identified Gine as Cult.</p>
<p>Ergo, at least one of our cops, probably two, are lying.</p>
<p>As far as the cult go, we&#8217;ve so far had 4 nights. If we started with just one cult leader, that&#8217;s 5 Cult members. We&#8217;ve killed 2 of those, so we&#8217;d be sitting on 3 now. In the Cult, the people who possibly have dinged radar are Peter, Max, Manuel, Rosie, Ernest and Victoria. These can&#8217;t all be Cult members. Any massive conspiracies we have will have to involve two factions that aren&#8217;t working together. Peter had an unconvincing overnight turnaround, so I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s one of them. So the three claimed cops, at least one of them ought to be non-cult. That&#8217;s not to say that one can&#8217;t be Mafia, though. </p>
<p>I would like Rosie and Max to claim which cop they are. I think it&#8217;s highly likely that we have real cops, and there&#8217;s only so many cops that can be found in the Simpsons. A look at the Simpsons Wiki says there are essentially 3 named cops. Wiggums is done, which leaves Lou and Eddie. </p>

<p>So the first claim. Cult leader. This one&#8217;s hard to defend because really anyone could be cult leader. If you&#8217;d like to give me more specific reasons I&#8217;d be happy to rebut them, but for now all I can tell you is that the reasons I haven&#8217;t been as abrasive as other players is not about my cult/townie status but my mafia/townie status. As in, I didn&#8217;t know there was a cult so I was trying to tell you that I wasn&#8217;t mafia. </p>

<p>Cynthia&#8217;s taken a general look at my comments and decided I might be scum. If you were to look more carefully, I&#8217;m actually pretty consistent.

<p>@Rosie, if you are telling the truth then you are Sane, so therefore Max is innocent. We can then assume this means Max is telling the truth, so has found a correct result about Ernest. This means Max is also Sane. Two Sane Cops is not impossible but unlikely in my books. Try to see it from our perspective: the only information you&#8217;ve offered us in your defence has either been offered by someone else first or we already knew.

<p>I&#8217;m intrigued by @Carlos&#8217; theory about a Bus Driver affecting Manuel. In a game like this it is entirely reasonable to expect the existence of a Bus Driver, and this idea provides a plausible third alternative as to why Manuel has reported how he has. After all, if Manuel is Scum then he has played poorly, and chose a peculiar target to lead a witch hunt against. That said, it&#8217;s always possible that he did not anticipate Gine&#8217;s death and intended to next attack Gine under the guise of being Insane.</p>
<p>Remember, we need to Lynch strategically. I think our greatest Lynch was Fred &#8211; even if he&#8217;d turned out innocent his death would have provided strong evidence against someone else. This is how we should aim to play.</p>

"<p>Few points:</p>
<p>1. Gameplay</p>
<p>We should make sure we don&#8217;t start playing too empirically. The reason we were smashing this game at the start was because we assessed the believability and value of individual players and began lynching the best options. Right now we seem to be trying to make a lynch by compromising the results of 3 &#8220;cops&#8221; who all seem to be somewhat dodgy, and a watcher who is either highly confused or unreliable. Use the little grey cells and focus on behaviour; its so damn psychological.</p>
<p>2. Role-claiming</p>
<p>Importantly, people are coming closer and closer to role-claiming. We are not at the point of a mass-claim yet. At the moment, the only reason for a claim is to avoid death or prevent the death of a knowingly innocent townie. That is how I intend to continue playing and given that our threat is the cult, rather than mafia, role-claiming provides us with little help.</p>
<p>3. J&#8217;accuse!</p>
<p>In addition to the big 2 currently put forward (Manuel and Rosie), I am highly wary of @Victoria. Today&#8217;s posts by her seem to reinforce those tells I spoke about yesterday. She is &#8220;confused&#8221; and &#8220;lost&#8221; about game mechanics (misdirection). Most of her statements seemed to be grounded in doubt and are highly hypothetical (buddying). She tends not to make statements that may allude to anyone&#8217;s guilt unless they are a formal vote as seen above, and even then it tends to be as a part of wagon. It is vocal whilst unobtrusive, substantial while non-confrontational. To me it is scummy behaviour, particularly smacking of one that does not wish to die (which, while anyone, is a good indicator of cult leader). As such, I believe that Victoria may very likely be cult leader, or in the alternative a mafioso. </p>
<p>## Vote Victoria</p>
<p>For the record, I am totally aware that this counter accusation makes it look like I am trying to defend Rosie, which would implicate myself should she turn out to be cult leader or otherwise. The fact that I am elucidating this fact from the outset should hopefully point towards this not being the case. </p>
<p>@Victoria: The sooner you can respond to my accusation the better &#8211; It is early days and I feel your response to this direct accusation should fairly rapidly either galvanise or alleviate my suspicions of you.</p>

<p>LIKELY TOWNIES (or at least non-leaders)</p>
<p>Carlos &#8211; Whether or not you believe him to be Cult (personally I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that likely) he has been CONFIRMED as Mayor by the Gods. They&#8217;re just not going to make the Mayor and the Cult leader the same person, it would make them way overpowered.</p>
<p>Charles &#8211; Yes I know, putting myself, but try to look at it objectively: I have role claimed as Dr Marvin Monroe and helped with or instigated every successful Lynch so far. I have also been reasonably calm and logical in my posts, while being vocal, something which I think is more likely for a Townie than Cult. I am also probably able to prevent Cult conversions and possibly uncultable myself.</p>
<p>Madeline &#8211; Long, well-thought out posts that have included an allusion to a role claim, although there are a few possibilities as to what that is. Has also helped with a couple of good Lynches. Obviously, like most of us, there is the possibility that Madelineis Cult but I find it very unlikely she is the leader.</p>
<p>Cynthia &#8211; Much the same as Madeline minus the role claim. She has been very successful at deducing Scum and has offered detailed and logical posts, making herself a Mafia target &#8211; a poor move for the leader. Again, possible Cult convert, but not leader.</p>
<p>Beth &#8211; Similar to Madeline and Cynthia. Being overly vocal simply isn&#8217;t in the leader&#8217;s interest.</p>
<p>Max &#8211; While I question his sanity, I believe Max&#8217;s role claim. Similar to Carlos, a cop isn&#8217;t going to be the leader. Also too risky a bluff for the leader; could be a recruit.</p>
<p>SUSPECTS</p>
<p>Rosie &#8211; Just read Madeline&#8217;s post. I don&#8217;t like to just say &#8220;Yeah, I agree!&#8221; but I really couldn&#8217;t have put it better. If TL;DR the gist is that she has been defended by both Frank and Gine, known Cult recruits. She also role claimed as Cop &#8220;confirming&#8221; information we simply don&#8217;t know to be true which seemed to be in the attempt to force a Lynching.</p>
<p>Manuel &#8211; Metagaming again, I just can&#8217;t see the Gods putting in a &#8220;random&#8221; cop. It would be so stupid and confusing. It&#8217;s also completely unheard of. No, I think either a) Manuel is Cult and his posts yesterday were a poor attempt to cover for Gine, or b) Manuel is Mafia and was attempting to pose Insane in order to get Gine Lynched. I don&#8217;t find b) likely. Why implicate Ernest? Why would the Mafia then kill Gine?</p>
<p>Ernest &#8211; If you don&#8217;t believe Rosie is lying, then that&#8217;s two Cops who have come up with a guilty verdict for Ernest. There is another possibility I have considered; that Rosie is lying (and Mafia), and that Max is Insane with a cyclical system. That is, Townies come up Cult (explaining Carlos&#8217; result), which would mean Cult come up Mafia and Mafia come up Townie. This would imply Ernest is Cult. Not to mention his rather obvious attempt to deflect attention above, he is very likely Scum in my mind.</p>
<p>Shelly &#8211; Jester, I know. Sure. Let&#8217;s leave her alone for the rest of the game, because she&#8217;s the Jester. I know I was one of the more vocal advocates for just ignoring her earlier in the game, but I just can&#8217;t make sense of her post yesterday. Role claiming as Jester is crazy.

"<p>Hi everybody. </p>
<p>First I want to apologise for the part I played in lynching russel, our fist townie lynch. My only defense is that I didn&#8217;t give myself enough time to think. @Manuel posted with only two and a half hours till sunset, which is weird enough on it&#8217;s own to be suspicious given the extra long day. My first instinct was to quickly skim back over the last few days to see if what he was saying made sense, and at first glance I could understand a cop investigating the people he said he did, in the order he did it. So I took him at his word and tried to work out the best course of action, and given the time I first thought it best to support those who decided to lynch Russel. I changed my mind and thought it better to Lynch @Rosie, but this was way too last minute to effect the result.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the post from @Frank on day 2:</p>
<p>Frank<br />
August 4, 2012 at 10:01 AM<br />
&#8230;<br />
Firstly I think all of you that are voting for Rosie are becoming desperate and blindlessly stabbing in the dark. Although I do agree that the silent ones can be deadly, you all must remember that we are playing with inexperienced players. I remember in my first Mafia game, I didnt say a thing simply because I was overwhelmed and that game was much smaller and much more relaxed than this one. And before you all jump to the conclusion that Im trying to protect Rosie, Im not. She very well might be mafia, we just dont know. And that is precisely the problem. We have absolutely know information about her at all. Does that mean that shes mafia? Who knows. But voting for her now may be a potentially fatal mistake if she is innocent and has a night ability that will help the town.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Now Frank is a confirmed Mafioso and Cult recruit. We don&#8217;t know if he was culted at the time, but it&#8217;s something to think about either way. </p>
<p>Now, @Gine has turned up as a cult recruit as well. He could&#8217;ve been culted last night before being killed but assume for a second he wasn&#8217;t, he also defended Rosie</p>
<p>Gine<br />
August 11, 2012 at 11:52 AM<br />
Charles, you shouldnt be running on your gut, we have plenty of facts to make decisions with.<br />
Sure: Christy, Clarence, Patty, and Victoria are good targets because theyve said very little and none have them have role revealed.<br />
But Rosie has provided useful, testable information. Shes the last of this bunch that should be lynched. Well quickly find out if shes been lying, we cant with the others.<br />
I expect the true cop to get converted immediately after their reveal, because it will make finding the cult leader almost impossible.</p>
<p>Honestly, Rosie hasn&#8217;t provided useful testable information. She confirmed @Max&#8217;s alignment and his investigation of @Ernest. This actually adds no useful information, because we can just test Max&#8217;s abilities with a lynch of one of his suspects or even him. Gine became very irrational on day 4 IMO but he did defend Rosie even if it was for not great reasons.</p>
<p>Now we have 4 night&#8217;s that cult member&#8217;s could&#8217;ve been recruited in, and 2 confirmed cult recruits, and again IMO a very likely 3rd in Carlos (@Max&#8217;s claim to a sane detective are strengthened by Manuel&#8217;s likely randomness or lying). If we assume it is the case then neither @Manuel or @Peter were cult recruits yesterday. The could still be the Cult leader though. So while there is confusion around what Peter saw, he&#8217;s not likely to be protecting the cult, unless he&#8217;s the leader. </p>
<p>I think unlikely that @Manuel is cult leader as both Gine and Carlos were willing to vote for him. He is however suspicious.</p>
<p>I also think @Peter is unlikely to be leader given the logic I used yesterday.</p>
<p>My most likely Cult leader Rosie, for acting suspicious and being defended by potential (since we don&#8217;t know if they were recruited at the time) cult conveys.</p>
<p>so </p>
<p>## Vote Rosie</p>
<p>Other things to think about:</p>
<p>How did Frank die in the night?</p>
<p>Is it significant that Gine was found beaten rather than stabbed or shot?</p>
<p>Whatever is revealed by our roleclaimed investigators from last night. </p>
<p>Max and Manuel have listed all their investigations, but Rosie hasn&#8217;t listed one of her investigations or told us that she didn&#8217;t investigate one of the nights (probably because she&#8217;s lying). It would be great to hear from all three to see if we can work out if there is a liar or if Manuel is random. </p>
<p>Peter, I know you said you learnt nothing on night 3. Is this because you didn&#8217;t investigate anyone or because the person did nothing/wasn&#8217;t visited. This is useful information. Also, what&#8217;s your explanation for not seeing @Jeff visit Gine on night 2?</p>

"<p>From reading all the above comments, I think our best option at this stage is to lynch Manuel. Everyone seems reasonably sure that he is, at the very least, dodgy.</p>

"<p>@Manuel &#8211; Unless you figured that Gine was important enough to protect and didn&#8217;t realise he would die last night.</p>
<p>@Victoria &#8211; As Manuel himself has said, there is no cop role that explains his results except for random. I find it highly likely that he is indeed Chief Wiggum (it&#8217;s a pretty big and normal role, so he&#8217;s likely to be in the game, so there ought to have been a counterclaim if he weren&#8217;t). HOWEVER, given the result pattern, I think it&#8217;s probably that he&#8217;s a cult member trying to protect one of his own.</p>
<p>@Paul &#8211; On the very first day, that is, before the Cult had a chance to recruit anybody, Gine said that I was the Mayor. His death role-reveal confirms that he wasn&#8217;t lying. Therefore, I am certainly the Mayor, which means I can&#8217;t be Cult Leader. I was also watched Night 1 and Bus Drivered Night 2, so were I culted, it would have to be after that.</p>
<p>But even that&#8217;s a sideshow to the fact that I am one of the most vocal, but more importantly, most watched in the game. Culting me would be incredibly risky business. I think that Gine&#8217;s fervent protecting of me yesterday is either an artefact of his role (he still needs me alive) or, more likely, he suspected he was going to die soon and was trying to buddy to me to protect his real cult allies.</p>

<p>This round to further eliminate the cult, i would like to put forward the names Manuel and Carlos.  Even though we should also be aware of the the every present threat of the mafia.

"<p>Ok, I&#8217;m incredibly confused. I assumed I was the insane cop, because Russell came back as mafia when I investigated him, and then turned out to be townie (really sorry about that though). Which would then have made Gine and Ernest mafia, because they both came back as townie, but apparently Gine is townie recruited cult..? I was told (and checked again because I&#8217;m confused), that if I&#8217;m insane and investigate cult members, they appear as neutral, and vice versa. I don&#8217;t understand what role I can be to get those results, does anyone know of other weird cop roles? That aren&#8217;t paranoid/naive (because I have gotten both mafia and townie results), and possibly not insane, because I&#8217;m not getting the complete opposite all the time. I&#8217;m trying to work that out to see if my information about the person I investigated last night is in any way useful or if I should stop trying to prevent getting it wrong again, at least until we know which way I&#8217;m being screwed over with results</p>

"<p>I wasnt able to hop on towards the end of the previous day, but I dont know why everyone decided to vote for russel. The reasons was because was mafia right? but we wanted to be killing cult??? seems abit odd to me. Thank you Mafia for killing Gine, unless you targeted carlos or someone else that resulted in gines death.</p>
<p> Heres a quick repost from earlier:</p>
<p>Max Results:<br />
 Carlos  Cult<br />
 Ernest  Mafia</p>
<p>Rosie Results:<br />
 Max  Townie<br />
 Ernest  Mafia</p>
<p>Manuel Results:<br />
 Gine  Townie<br />
 Russell  Mafia<br />
 Ernest  Townie</p>
<p>Gine was very protective of Carlos and Manuel after I accused him and both of them of being cult. I recon thats the direction we should head. Peter has either made a mistake about Gine visiting Manual (or God made a mistake) or he is Lying. Manuel claimed Russell was mafia, which was false, and that Gine was a townie (this way on day 1, so depending when Gine was recruited, may or may not be true). The Gods also (apparently) confirmed with someone that if a cop was insane, they would see cult as unaligned. Either way, Manuel is lying by the looks of it.  </p>
<p>I find it highly unlikely that there are two normal cops in this game, and since Rosie and Max both have seen Ernest as Mafia, I think one must be lying. (perhaps using Ernest as a sacrafice to confirm thier cop role) I would suggest Rosie as the lying mafia(probably not cult) because Max called Ernest as mafia first, and then Rosie followed along with it, knowing there was no hope for Ernest.</p>
<p>Im not sure which action to take next.</p>
",True
"<p>@Carlos I&#8217;ll just quickly run my logic by you because I didn&#8217;t explain myself very well.<br />
Manuel: Ernest Townie, Russell Mafia.<br />
Max and Rosie: Ernest Mafia.<br />
Result: Russell Townie.<br />
So Manuel is insane or lying. If insane, then Russell is townie (confirmed) and Ernest is Mafia (which would suggest that Max and Rosie are sane).<br />
If he was just lying then surely he knew he would soon be found out following the death of russell, therefore a lie would probably be an attempt to fake insane, which would further implicate Ernest as Mafia&#8230; which could actually mean a great many things, like maybe he&#8217;s mafia himself trying to kill off a townie, or maybe he&#8217;s cult trying to kill both mafia and townie.</p>
<p>I hope I haven&#8217;t just started making less sense&#8230;</p>
",True
"<p>I posted that and then three other people posted before me. </p>
<p>@Victoria &#8211; logically, these deaths mean absolutely nothing for the sanity of Rosie or Max, as they didn&#8217;t investigate Gine or Russell.</p>
<p>Gine certainly could not have visited Manuel as we can assume that first day he was Townie and thus not lying about his ability, unless members of the cult all go to a new recruitment or something? I&#8217;m not sure of the mechanics here. I&#8217;d err on the side of Peter lying.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s both Peter and Manuel caught in fairly lying-y positions.</p>
",True
"<p>Well this is interesting. I was already to start firing questions at Gine, as Russell&#8217;s innocence means either:</p>
<p>a) Manuel is Insane; or<br />
b) Manuel is lying.</p>
<p>In the case of a), this would suggest Gine is scum and should be Lynched, in the case of b), Manuel is probably Scum, and is potentially covering up the fact that Gine visited him to convert him to the Cult, so Gine should be Lynched. The Mafia seem to have done this for us. Whether or not their intentions were good is another question, but the fact he was Cult without being Cult leader is interesting.</p>
<p>At this point I am quite suspicious of @Manuel, and I imagine I am not the only one. Madeline&#8217;s last minute revelation yesterday about Rosie being defended by Frank is an interesting thought, and I would quite like to hear from her as well.</p>
",True
"<p>So, that means that you&#8217;re going to have a lot of explaining to do, Manuel. You are almost certainly lying. You have a Townie result for Gine and a Mafia result for Russell. Both of them are apparently town, and Gine was Cult, despite the fact that you said you could identify Cult. The latter of those is explicable, as maybe Gine was culted after you investigated him, but the former? Not so much.</p>
<p>So this means that Mafia either targetted me or Gine last night, and it was probably Gine straight up.</p>
",True
"<p>Then again, Gine was only cult recruited. So he can&#8217;t recruit. So it still doesn&#8217;t make sense for him to be visiting Manuel. So Manuel is not necessarily cult. But uh, Ernest is still mafia and Carlos is probably Cult&#8230; unless that was the &#8216;bullet&#8217; that Gine took. Oh, my head hurts.</p>
",True
"<p>Oh oh no okay I misread that. Things make sense again.</p>
",True
"<p>Oh man I didnt realize night would fall that early. I cant believe we lynched Russell, I didnt even see that one coming. At the very least, I suppose we didnt lose a more valuable doctor. And.<br />
Please correct me if Im wrong but this means that Max and Rosie are perfectly sane, therefore Ernest is mafia, and Gine is not townie, and Carlos is cult. Which means that Gine has been lying to us, which means that Peter could well be telling the truth about him visiting Manuel<br />
But then again, the death of Gine shows no signs of being cult so it makes utterly no sense for him to go walk about in the night. Which means Peter is lying or insane. And, Gine was townie so actually forget what I just said. Wait, what?!!</p>
